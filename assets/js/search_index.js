        "content": "Today I’m happy to announce the publication of not one, but four new courses on the fundamentals of Buddhism: Buddhism 101 An introduction suitable for everyone, especially beginners and people completely new to Buddhism. The Early Buddhist Texts An introduction to the Buddhist Canon suitable for everyone. This courses is based on Bhikkhu Bodhi’s popular anthology, In The Buddha’s Words. The Form(s) of Buddhism An introduction to the history and religious aspects of Buddhism, including analysis of the Sangha and what it takes to call yourself a Buddhist. The Function of Buddhism An introduction to the Buddhist practice, placing the meditative and ethical trainings in their broader developmental context. I’ve been working on them for a long time and I’m happy to finally be able to share them. I’m especially proud of the Form and Function courses and recommend them both to novices and experts alike. I know I learned a lot while making them! As always, you can find the courses on Google Drive or right here. Happy Studying! Than Khemarato",

        "content": "Today I’m happy to welcome you to The Open Buddhist University at GitHub. Congratulations on your admission! As you may have noticed, there are two primary ways to study here: taking our courses or hanging out at the library. The library contains all the best content I’ve found for learning about Buddhism. Every piece featured in the bibliographies has been vetted for both accuracy and relevance. For a video tour of the website, click here! As I slowly review and add more content, I highlight the best finds here as well as in the email newsletter, so be sure to subscribe for the best free content on Buddhism available online. Here are a few of my favorite pieces you might want to check out first, if you haven’t already: The Miracle of Mindfulness (1975) – Thích Nhất Hạnh In this beautiful letter to a friend (and one of my favorite books period), Thay offers practical advice and encouragement to cultivate mindfulness: the quality of presence and wakefulness in our life. From washing the dishes to answering the phone, he reminds us that each moment holds within it the seeds of understanding and peace. Highly recommended for all, especially newcomers to Buddhism or meditation, or anyone looking to brighten their day. Featured in the course, \" Buddhism 101\" Putting Cruelty First (1982) – Judith Shklar In this essay, Judith Shklar (not a Buddhist) ponders the implications of placing cruelty first (as the Buddha did). She shows how this position stands at odds with both Christian piety and neoliberal apathy and carves out a more realistic humanism than either extreme. Featured in the course, \" The Function of Buddhism\" Early Buddhism: A Conversation with Kalupahana (1991) – Richard Payne and David J. Kalupahana On separating out early from later Buddhism and why it matters. Featured in the course, \" The Early Buddhist Texts\" The Economy of Gifts (1997) – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro Ajahn Geoff explains how the monastic institution works by creating an economy of gifts. Featured in the course, \" The Form of Buddhism\" SN 22.86: Anuradha Sutta (2006) – Joseph Goldstein Who was the Buddha in his own words? In this story, he calls himself the “Tathagata” or “Truth-Arriver”, and he responds to a question on what will become of him after his death. The Buddha explains that he doesn’t talk in such terms, as he has overcome all such notions as “I am the body” or “I am the mind” so how could such a question ever be answered? He ends the discourse by famously saying that all he teaches is suffering and the end of suffering, thus redirecting our attention from empty philosophical musings to the things that matter most. Featured in the course, \" Buddhism 101\" Dealing with Difficult People (2008) – Ajahn Brahm Ajahn Brahm gives a talk on how to achieve harmony in real life, where we all-too-often meet difficult people. Featured in the course, \" The Function of Buddhism\" On Love (2010) – Ajahn Jayasaro What lies behind this insistence on love is a worry: without a deep-seated fear that one day love would no longer exist (or exist in the same way) why would anyone feel that they have to insist upon it so much? Featured in the course, \" Buddhism 101\" Drums and Bells – Qing De Monastery (2013) A lonely temple, nestled in the mountains of central Taiwan, says goodnight. Featured in the course, \" The Form of Buddhism\" Congratulations again on making it here. I hope you learn something truly worthwhile, and I invite you to email me (at the address below) with any questions or feedback you may have. Yours etc,The Librarian, Than Khemarato",

Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts Lay Buddhism The Buddhist Path Buddhist Philosophy Lots of new content has been added to fill those bibliographies, so check them out! In particular I’m excited to share with you: Ajahn Maha Bua’s classic sermons, A Life of Inner Quality Dr Tucker telling us about the evidence for reincarnation And Curtis White asks us to question our dogmatic belief in materialism. Rupert Gethin encouraging us to reassess how we read the mythology of the Buddhist Canon Ajahn Brahm talking about the Buddha, supernatural powers, and his time in Thailand in this fun sutta study class Ajahn Geoff writing about the unconditional purity of heart Ajahn Sujato defending both the bardo and comparative studies in this compelling paper Sir Edward Dyer rejoicing in his virtue Lawrence Mills’ translation of Snp 4.2 SN 1.71, which answers the question of when the Buddha would approve of murder! This lovely sutta (SN 35.247) which compares cognitive dissonance to six animals tied together: either with or without the “post” of mindfulness And, with calamity crushing in from all sides these days, The Mountain Simile feels more relevant than ever. And last, but certainly not least, I am very excited to share with you this profound interview with Professor Charles Hallisey which has been added to Buddhism and the Early Buddhist Texts. I hope you enjoy this month’s arrivals and, as always, feel free to email me with any thoughts or questions you might have. Yours etc, The Librarian Than Khemarato",

        "content": "This months readings are back to basics. There are two new topical reading lists on Monastic Buddhism and Buddhist Ethics and I’ve added a number of suttas to the library. There’s a lot of good stuff there to check out, but here are a few especially nice flowers just for you: Thig 14.1: Subha and the Libertine (1995) Subha Bhikkhuni finds a creative solution to sexual harassment. Featured in the course, \" Buddhist Ethics\" MA 25: Discourse on the Five Ways of Putting an End to Anger (2006) Venerable Shariputra explains five ways to quell anger through wise attention, giving five memorable similes on being determined to find the good in everyone.

But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. AN 7.49: Perceptions in Detail (2018) Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless. What seven? The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering. To Be, or Not to Be (2018) – Masha Gessen someone is a sequence of choices, and the question is: Will my next choice be conscious, and will my ability to make it be unfettered?

        "content": "Today I’m proud to finally announce the meditation reading list. It might strike some as odd that a site about Buddhism could exist for months without a section on meditation, yet for as pivotal a psychotechnology as meditation is, it is also a rather contentious and challenging topic to teach—especially over the internet. While far from the final word on the subject, the bibliography here should provide a good starting point for the study and practice of meditation. And while far from complete, the reading list already contains some of my favorite talks, articles, and songs (!) which I highly recommend you check out: Have you come here to die? (2004) – Ajahn Brahm It’s interesting to walk through the graveyards of towns, and see that for the first few years after a person dies there may be a head stone, maybe someone remembers, but after twenty, thirty, or forty years, they could bulldoze the graves because the land is so valuable and plant somebody else in there. So even your head stone just crumbles to dust. All record of you living here is gone, because no one remembers who you were or what you did. Isn’t that beautiful? So why not do that right now? Bulldoze this idea of who you are Addressing the American Problem by Modeling Cognitive Development (2007) – Zachary Stein We, moderns but especially Americans, have a fundamental misunderstanding of cognitive development: we assume that higher-level functioning is always desired and so disparage and neglect fundamental cognitive skills. Anything You Synthesize (2008) – The American Dollar A beautiful music video about the passing of time. Featured in the course, \" An Introduction to Buddhist Philosophy\" How to Meditate: A Beginner’s Guide to Peace (2009) – Bhante Yuttadhammo My most highly recommended introduction to Buddhist meditation. Mindfulness According to Early Buddhist Sources (2012) – Bhikkhu Anālayo An engaging lecture at Spirit Rock on using text critical methods and personal practice to narrow in on an understanding of early Buddhist meditation practices. The Wheel (2012) – SOHN An incredible music video, perfectly capturing the world-weary feeling of saṃvega. Thoughts on Practice and Why We Do It (2013) – Pascal Auclair A heartfelt and spellbinding talk on meditation practice and expectations. The Liberative Role of Jhānic Joy (Pīti) and Pleasure (Sukha) in the Early Buddhist Path to Awakening (2015) – Keren Arbel the common interpretation of the jhānas as absorption-concentration attainments [is] incompatible with the teachings of the Pāli Nikāyas. […] one attains the jhānas, not by one-pointed concentration and absorption into a meditation object, but by releasing and letting go of the foothold of the unwholesome mind […] the entrance into the first jhāna is the actualization and embodiment of insight practice. Feasibility of a mindfulness-based intervention to address youth issues in Vietnam (2016) – Thao N. Le and Don T. Trieu Handicapped and at-risk Vietnamese youths share their appreciation of and enthusiasm for a mindfulness meditation course.

        "content": "This month I’m happy to announce two bibliographies on more advanced topics: nibbāna and the Pāli Canon. I’m especially happy to finally share with you: The Purpose of Practicing Meditation – Mahāsi Sayadaw (.epub) Mahasi Sayadaw’s classic summary of the Visuddhimagga providing an excellent (if dense!) map of the path. Aṅguttara Nikāya Anthology – Ven. Nyanaponika Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) Nyanaponika Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi’s anthology of suttas from the Numerical Discourses is now available for free online. The Dhammapada: The Buddha’s Path of Wisdom (1959) – Ācāriya Buddharakkhita A classic translation of the primary book of poetry from the Pāli Canon. Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: The Path to Arahantship (2005) – Luangta Maha Boowa An extremely profound and exceptionally rare book, Arahattamagga gives an unfiltered first-hand account of what it’s actually like to walk the entire Path—from its tumultuous beginning to its extraordinary finish. The Buddha Smiles: Humor in the Pali Canon (2015) – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro the Buddha himself rarely smiles in the Canon, and when he does, the reasons for his smile are never hilarious. Still, the Canon’s reputation for being devoid of humor is undeserved. It’s there in the Canon, but it often goes unrecognized. All classics, which I recommend most highly to any serious student—along with the rest of the library, of course, which remains open 7 days a week (regardless of Covid-19).

        "content": "Following on the Pāli Canon readings from last month, this month the library added tags on the Vinaya and Sutta Pitikas as well as the Chinese Agamas. I’m especially happy to share this translation of the Canonical Vinaya: Analysis of the Bhikkhu-Pātimokkha: A translation of the Mahā-Vibhaṅga from the Vinaya-Piṭaka – Bhante Suddhāso (.pdf) The canonical explication of the monastic rules. As well as this anthology of stories about the Buddha’s disciples: Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy – Ven. Nyanaponika Thera and Hellmuth Hecker (.pdf) Just as the sun is valued not only for its own intrinsic radiance but also for its ability to illuminate the world, so the brilliance of the Buddha is determined not only by the clarity of his Teaching but by his ability to illuminate those who came to him for refuge The Buddha’s first generation of followers established the traditions and values of the early Sangha. Indeed, it is nearly impossible to understand Buddhism without understanding the lives of the early Buddhist saints. This rich and inspiring series of biographies editted by Bhikkhu Bodhi mainly draws from the traditional commentaries of the Theravada tradition and so provides an excellent balance between readability and faithfulness to the source material. A must read for all students of Buddhism. But, in addition to the usual Buddhist stuff, this month also saw the addition of a new tag on The (Human) World featuring miscellaneous favorites of mine, such as: Heartwood of the Bodhi Tree: The Buddha’s Teaching on Voidness (1985) – Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu To be female is to have the dukkha of a female. To be male is to have the dukkha of a male. […] If we deludedly think ‘I am happy’ then we must suffer accordingly. Mother Earth Mother Board (1996) – Neal Stephenson In which the hacker tourist ventures forth across the wide and wondrous meatspace of three continents, acquainting himself with the customs and dialects of previously unknown and unchronicled folk … and other material pertaining to the business and technology of Undersea Fiber-Optic Cables, as well as an account of the laying of the longest wire on Earth SN 35.82: The World (1997) Insofar as it disintegrates, it is called the ‘world.’ Four Futures (2011) – Peter Frase One thing we can be certain of is that capitalism will end. As with all the tags, if there’s any favorite of yours missing, I’d love to hear about them! Feel free to email suggestions or accolades any time.

        "content": "This month the library took its first tentative steps towards covering the different forms of Buddhism, with new bibliographies on Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism. From the South, I’d like to highlight: Living Buddhist Masters – Jack Kornfield (.pdf) teachings from twelve of the greatest masters and monasteries in the Theravada tradition This classic book on insight meditation introduced the West to the Theravada Tradition of Southeast Asia and launched the career of not only its author, but also many of his readers who subsequently sought out, learned from, and carried on the tradition of these venerable masters. It’s basically impossible to understand modern Theravada Buddhism without being familiar with at least most of the teachers featured in this outstanding book, but its value isn’t strictly historical as the wisdom and advice it contains is invaluable not just to scholars but also to any serious meditator intent on realizing the fruits of insight practice. MN 26: Ariyapariyesanā Sutta (The Noble Search) (.pdf) Bhikkhus, before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too, being myself subject to birth, sought what was also subject to birth The Buddha’s own spiritual autobiography, from searching to finding true deliverance. Saving Buddhism: The Impermanence of Religion in Colonial Burma – Alicia Turner To understand Buddhism, one must understand the tension between the knowledge of impermanence and the love of the Dharma. This sense of loss has defined Buddhism from the Buddha’s Parinirvana through to the present day. In this illuminating interview, we see how this meme of the declining Dhamma gave rise to particular responses among Burmese Buddhists to British Colonialism and how those reactions helped to birth modern Buddhism. From the Northern schools of Buddhism, this month saw the addition of these two Tibetan gems: How to Cultivate Concentration – Mipham Rinpoche (.pdf) You might wish to drink the nectar of calm abiding… From the Oral Tradition – Nyarong Tertön Sogyal Rinpoche (.pdf) the time for discovering Buddha directly, you must remain alone A short poem on overcoming our barriers and sticking to the practice. And lastly, I wanted to share with you this sutta, which both traditions will agree is worth reading again and again: MN 22: The Simile of the Water Snake (.pdf) I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Understanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft, you should let go even of Dhammas, to say nothing of non-Dhammas. In this famous and much-celebrated sutta, the Buddha teaches how to properly grasp Buddhist philosophy so as not to lead to more suffering. As always, if you find any typos or problems with the site, have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to drop me a line. I’d love to hear from you.

        "content": "Hello, friend! Today I’m happy to announce the addition of a new feature and a few new courses for the more serious scholars, as well as a few polemics on contemporary issues which are near and dear to my heart. But first, the courses! This month I’ve added three new courses on the primary languages of the Early Buddhist Texts: Chinese and Pāli. Chinese Buddhist Writing is a course for Buddhists with some prior knowledge of Mandarin (or who are willing to hussle to get those fundamentals elsewhere) who would like help reading Chinese Buddhist scriptures. This course goes character-by-character through the different strata of Chinese texts, giving a comprehensive introduction to Buddhist Chinese from ancient Indian translations to esoteric treatises. The Pāli Primer Course is a fun introduction to the Pāli Language for everyone, and for those who have some background already, the intermediate Pāli course will get you into the suttas themselves. Both classes are taught by the Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi. In case it’s helpful to academics, I’ve added the Bibtex information for all the items in the library to the bottom of each piece’s permalink page. And for those who use bibliographic software, like JabRef, you can now download the entire library as a single .bib file for importing into your reference manager of choice, here. And, on a more serious note, 2020 has been a year. With wildfires and a pandemic raging across the globe, it’s easy to feel powerless in the face of such large problems. But there are things we can do and, with your indulgence, I’d like to talk about four of them here: The Life You Can Save – Peter Singer In this now-classic monograph, Peter Singer reminds us that giving money to charity really does make a difference. Largely in response to this book’s call for better data, GiveWell.org has, for years now, been identifying the charities which demonstrably save the most lives for the least amount of additional funding. In a plague year, I can hardly think of better karma to make, so please, read Singer’s (free!) ebook, and then reconsider how much you can afford to give. The Green Pill – Melanie Joy The second biggest, if not always easiest, way to make a difference is to eat less meat. In this podcast with Ezra Klein, Melanie Joy talks about why that’s so hard to do in our carnistic culture. Sexual Consent – Milena Popova (.pdf) (.epub) Whether you’re sexually active or not, the third precept against sexual misconduct obliges us to consider carefully the nuances of consent. With chapters covering culture, power, negotiation, activism, and more, this concise yet comprehensive monograph will surely help structure and guide any investigation into this important and uncomfortable topic. Should Trees Have Standing: Toward Legal Rights for Natural Objects – Christopher D. Stone (.pdf) Lastly, beyond caring for the animals and each other, Chris Stone makes the mind-blowing case for the idea that everything should have rights. A utopian idea, perhaps, but one worth taking seriously as we rebuild the world in 2021. Wishing you a happy and most auspicious new year, 圖書管理員 Khemarato Bhikkhu",

The biggest news is that, thanks to a generous supporter, the website now has a proper domain: buddhistuniversity.net! The other technical improvement this month was the addition of a search page, where you can now plumb the depths of our archives like a pro! Expect more design improvements in the next couple weeks, as we continue to make ourselves at home. In terms of content, The University is now proud to offer a new course on the Buddha in the Pāli Texts featuring a couple new PDFs about the Buddha from Bhikkhu Bodhi and Bhikkhu Ānandajoti released just a few weeks ago (!) along with this classic paper by Bhikkhu Anālayo attempting to reconstruct a sensible version of the Bhikkhuni Order formation narrative. Over at the library, Rober Mayer explains why Tibetan Treasure literature may not be as innovative as you’d imagine, Jorie Graham catches sight of the now, Ezra Klein talks about the most important book he read last year with its author, and Helena de Bres explains the moral case for eating local food. Be sure to check them out! As always, you can email me (now at a shiny new email address!) with any comments, questions, concerns, or compliments you may have. Until next month, Khemarato Bhikkhu Librarian in Chief",

        "content": "This short month saw two major additions to The University: an advanced course on Nibbāna (following up on our previous course) and a new bibliography of Vinaya Studies (following up on our previous bibliographies on monasticism and the canon). Somewhat complicating “The Canon,” Anne Blackburn, for example, encourages us to think about its “practical” subset and Ajahn Geoff highlights a few conflicts between The Canon and its commentaries in his extensive, and highly recommended, guide to the Vinaya. The bibliography here aims to help (primarily monastics) make use of the texts. On the meditation side, in addition to the profound lectures by Bhikkhu Analayo in the aforementioned course, I am also very excited this month to share with you this classic talk on impermanence by Ayya Khema which beautifully summarizes the path of Vipassana Meditation. A real gem, be sure to give it a listen and check out our library’s other great talks! As always, if you have any feedback or questions, please feel free to email them in!

        "content": "This month I’ve added two, new bibliographies to the site on the world of Early Buddhism: The Buddha’s India and Characters in the Early Buddhist Texts. Among the many interesting and compelling characters in the canon, I’ll just highlight one here: Jīvaka. Not only is his story charming as a tale, but you can now read the original telling thanks to Ajahn Brahmali’s new translation of the Vinaya Piṭaka which just dropped this month on SuttaCentral. A huge congratulations to him and the SuttaCentral team for launching the latest update to their site, and a huge encouragement to you, dear reader, to go and check it out! In Buddha’s India, I’ve highlighted works that help explain the social world that the Buddha was born into and how he transformed it. This is especially visible in how Buddhism adopted and adapted legendary beings from the local culture. Bhante Sujato’s talk about the Buddhist adoption of “Evil Creatures” and Linda Covill’s article on the adaptation of “Celestial Nymphs” are both especially inspiring examples of how skillfully this was done. Buddhism itself, of course, also adapted in the centuries since its founder. Considering the diversity of early Buddhist schools, it may be tempting to project the current diversity of Buddhism back onto ancient India, but Florin Deleanu points out that this may be mistaken in his excellent overview of the Śrāvakabhūmi, a meditation manual preserved by a Mahayana school which closely parallels the Visuddhimagga. The differences are minor, but telling. There is more to say about Indian Buddhism, of course, but I’ll save some for next month. So, for now, I’ll just leave you with this facinating Chemical History of a Candle: one of my favorite science videos on YouTube. Not related to anything, just thought I’d share :_) If you have any videos, articles, feedback or anything else you’d like to share, as always, feel free to drop me a line.

        "content": "As promised last month, this month we continue to explore Buddhist India: this time after the Buddha, with bibliographies on Indian Buddhism after the Buddha (up to the first sectarian splits) and on Buddhist pilgrimage today. There’s a lot of great scholarly content in the new bibliographies this month, so I encourage you (really!) to go and check them out. I won’t list every exciting thing here today, but I did want to highlight some work by four of my favorite Bhikkhu teachers: This talk by Bhante Yuttadhammo was delivered at the foot of the (Sri Lankan) Bodhi Tree and is such a good, atmospheric listen. If it inspires you to go on pilgrimage, check out the books there! In this book, Bhante Sujato explains how Buddhist sects, much like island birds, slowly evolved into separate species due to distance, not dramatic schisms—an important fact to keep in mind as you read about the early Buddhist sects. Bhikkhu Bodhi muses about the emergence of the Bodhisattva ideal in this thoughtful essay and Ajahn Geoff shares with us King Ashoka’s favorite suttas for preserving the religion giving us a taste of the questions and concerns which drove Indian Buddhist history as a whole. Lastly, this month marks a special milestone for the University. It was exactly one year ago yesterday that I first launched the University library with the goal of providing thousands of free books, articles, and talks across the breadth of Buddhist Studies. One year later, we now have over 1000 pieces, covering everything from the Agamas to the Vinaya, from the Buddha to the World and in that year, over a thousand scholars from 67 countries have come and downloaded an average of seven items each.1 It means a lot to me to see that so many people are interested in learning authentic Buddhism and want to keep the Dhamma as it always has been: free. Thank you for coming and studying with us, and I hope you will find the University a helpful resource for years to come. Looking to the future, there’s still much to do to bring greater depth to the University’s offerings. I look forward to delving deeper into Buddhist philosophy and history in the coming years, but I especially look forward to hearing your ideas about where the University could go from here. If you have any ideas, feel free to drop me a line, and until then: Thank you for reading!

        "content": "This month, we’ve added a new bibliography on Engaged Buddhism! It takes a sympathetic but critical look at the modernist movement, starting with the methodological problem of defining “Engaged Buddhism” in the first place. The bibliography then highlights several examples of Engaged Buddhists doing real good as well as a few, more problematic examples. In the end, it’s up to you to decide whether Engaged or “Disengaged” Buddhism is right for you, but I hope that you’ll at least find the topic as thought-provoking and engaging as I have! I’ve also been busy this month making backend improvements to the site. You may notice that the content pages load a little faster now, and that the “www.” is now gone from the front of our URLs. I also identified and fixed a number of broken links around the website: If you ran into one of them before, please accept my apologies about that! Hopefully they will be less frequent in the future. Lastly, I plan to spend the upcoming rains retreat almost entirely in seclusion away from the internet, so please anticipate that future updates will be less frequent.

As this rainy season ends, OBU sees a number of new pieces added to our existing collections, including some films and a few old JPTS articles. You can see the entire list of new content by subscribing to our new content RSS Feeds which will notify you when any new content is added to the library. For a primer on getting started with RSS, see the Wiki on SuttaCentral and if you have any questions, please ask in the comments there. Travel Logs Of all the new content added over the last few months, I’d especially like to recommend the following, absolutely captivating, pieces which give windows into a few, remote, Buddhist cultures: Stūpa, Sūtra, and Śarīra in China, c. 656–706 CE (2001) – T. H. Barrett what was the religious environment that encouraged the spread of the new technology of printing in late seventh century China? School Among Glaciers (2004) – Dorji Wangchuk A young teacher is assigned to Bhutan’s most remote school. The Ritual of Arhat Invitation during the Song Dynasty: Why did Mahāyānists Venerate the Arhat? (2007) – Ryan Bongseok Joo it appears contradictory that Chinese who follow the teachings of Mahāyāna Buddhism have worshipped arhats. […] who was the arhat for Chinese Buddhists? Tilling the Fields of Merit: The Institutionalization of Feminine Enlightenment in Tibet’s First Khenmo Program (2020) – Jue Liang and Andrew S. Taylor “A monastery is a place where equality is preached but not practiced; a gar is a place where equality is practiced but not preached.” FAQs I’d also like to highlight these beautiful answers to a few of the most commonly asked questions I see about Buddhist theory: The Doctrine of the Buddha-Nature in the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-Sūtra (1982) – Ming-Wood Liu Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that the MNS has provided the historical starting-point as well as the chief scriptural basis for enquiry into the problem of the Buddha-nature in China, and it would be difficult if not impossible to grasp the significance of the concept and its subsequent evolution in Chinese Buddhism without a proper understanding of the teaching of the MNS on the subject. The Symbolism of the Early Stūpa (1984) – Peter Harvey The four toraṇas, or gateways, [put] the stūpa, symbolically, at the place where four roads meet, as is specified in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta. Featured in the course, \" The Form of Buddhism\" Samādhi (Concentration) (2006) – Bhikkhu Anālayo An encyclopedic overview of the various kinds of samādhi and their place on the path. Enlightenment (2020) – Bhante Yuttadhammo As a result of seeing the truth of how craving leads to suffering, we have a moment where our minds cease all craving and release us from the incessant arising of experience Featured in the course, \" Nibbāna: The Goal of Buddhist Practice\" I found the above extremely helpful and interesting and I hope that you will too!

        "content": "This month, we’ve added hundreds of lectures by Bhikkhu Bodhi on the Majjhima and Aṅguttara Nikāyas. The Majjhima Nikāya course on this site had previously contained only Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lectures through 2010 which were hosted at the Bodhi monastery website. A “part 11” (from 2010–2015) covering the suttas not covered in the first 10 sections, however, exists on YouTube and can now be found on this website too. And after thirteen years (!) of lecturing on the Majjhima Nikāya, Bhikkhu Bodhi decided to continue his sutta study classes by going through the Aṅguttara Nikāya: a series which is still on-going today. You can follow that course on YouTube here. Many thanks to the eagle-eyed Redditor who pointed these links out to me and to everyone else who gave feedback on the website recently. The new, bolder color scheme unveiled this month was also based on your suggestions, so thank you all again and please keep them coming!

        "content": "Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery, in Redwood Valley California, was the first monastery in the United States to be established by followers of Ajahn Chah, a respected master of the Thai Forest Tradition. In 1988, lay disciples of Ajahn Chah’s student Ajahn Sumedho formed the Sanghapāla Foundation with the mission of creating a branch monastery in the lineage of Ajahn Chah. In 1990, Ajahn Amaro accompanied Ajahn Sumedho to California and became the central teacher for the Californians. Efforts to establish a California monastery moved slowly until 1995, when Venerable Master Hsüan Hua, the founding abbot of The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas (CTTB), approached his death. He instructed his students to give Ajahn Chah’s disciples 120 acres of CTTB-owned forested property in Redwood Valley. Master Hua had made a point of stating that it had been his life’s dream to bring the northern and southern traditions of Buddhism together again. His open-hearted offering enabled the communities (just 15 miles apart) to be physically close and to relate to each other with an atmosphere of mutual respect and harmony. Venerable Ajahn Pasanno and Venerable Ajahn Amaro guided the monastery as co-abbots starting in 1996. In 2010, Ajahn Amaro accepted an invitation to serve as abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery in England, leaving Ajahn Pasanno to lead the community for the next eight years. In the spring of 2018, Ajahn Pasanno stepped back from his role of abbot to enter a year-long retreat, after which he returned to Abhayagiri as its Guiding Elder. The monastery is now under the leadership of co-abbots Ajahn Karuṇadhammo and Ajahn Ñāniko. ~ From Abhayagiri’s website",

He became interested in the Northern parallels to the Pāli Canon and quickly picked up Sanskrit, ancient Chinese, and Tibetan, publishing Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna in 2013. Today, Bhikkhu Anālayo is the preeminent comparative textual scholar of early Buddhism.

He received from them a copy of the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta which he then chanted and practiced diligently. Leaving his job in 1974 to meditate full time, he was ordained at Wat Bowon by Somdet Yan himself in 1975 thanks to the help of Bhikkhu Khantipalo before traveling to Wat Pa Baan Taad where he would train under Luangta Maha Bua for the next nine years.

Being asked, I explain to them the noble truth of suffering, and I satisfy their minds The Buddha then goes on to enumerate in detail the path of tranquility meditation and its fruits, including several uncommon lists, such as the eight liberations and the ten kasiṇas, the perfection of which is the ultimate reason the Sangha honors and respects their teacher.

They weren’t pure and peaceful right from the beginning. They got where they are through effort. And there’s no reason why you can’t put forth that same effort.

Most helpful is his list in chapter 7 where he outlines specifically the differences he sees between Buddhism and Western Romanticism. Even if you ultimately disagree with Ajahn Geoff’s analysis, this is still an important work to engage with seriously, as it forces a direct confrontation with our religious assumptions and motivations.",

A gorgeous pair of edited volumes collecting papers and artwork grappling with the enormity of climate change and painting a uniquely multifaceted portrait of our damaged planet. Better suited to the coffee-table than the night-stand, these hefty books contain not a single, pat message but just a series of snapshots from around our pale blue dot.",

Despite Bill’s many painful experiences, he never lost his faith in the transformative, human potential to awaken. His lifetime of spiritual stumbling is a rich source of warnings and advice, especially for Westerners still struggling to get a foothold in a tradition. That said, however, the book’s interpretation of “enlightenment” should be taken cautiously, as his understanding seems to come from ecumenical assumptions that the various “contemplative traditions” (never defined) all describe the same goal. A bit of a black sheep even within the heterodox, secular “Insight” community, Bill Hamilton is best read with his own warning in mind, that “monks and nuns make safer teachers than laypeople, especially if they are actively associated with their tradition.”",

In this thousand-page tome, Bhikkhu Analayo goes systematically through the MN, one sutta at a time, and explains how the Pāli text differs (or not) from its parallels preserved in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan. Perhaps surprisingly, they don’t differ all that much, though in some places the differences do shed light on the original teaching and shows what kinds of changes occurred to the texts during the process of transmission. The book begins and ends with Bhikkhu Analayo’s reflections on the EBTs and the process of oral transmission, and while the book could certainly be read cover-to-cover, the primary way to use this book is as a reference work alongside the Majjhima Nikaya.

The seminar, “The Chinese Translation of the Dīrgha-āgama (長 阿含經, Taishō 1)”, took place on 18 and 19 October, 2013. It was organised in collaboration with the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies at Dharma Drum Mountain and the Numata Center for Bud- dhist Studies at Hamburg University. The event was generously funded by the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.

A thorough defense of beauty and of its power to push the boundaries of our concern outward. Not written from the Buddhist perspective, these essays dismiss (too?) casually the ugly failure modes of beauty: the acquisitiveness, possessiveness, and jealousy which consume many the beholder. However, I find it a useful corollary or even corrective to the standard Buddhist “rejection” of aesthetics, explaining how beauty can condition becoming’s wholesome forms. In this way, we start to view the spiritual education as a kind of aesthetic education: acquainting the student with “truer” sources of beauty and affording them the more sublime responses outlined in these notes.",

It is from the Visuddhimagga that we get the threefold division of the path into Sīla, Samādhi and Paññā. The ideas of “neighborhood” concentration, the confusion over samatha and vipassana, and much else in the contemporary Theravada world can all be traced back to this enormously influential tome. In its day, a landmark of commentarial scholarship and synthesis, today it contains some of the clearest and most detailed descriptions of the advanced stages of meditation that we have from ancient times. Despite, or perhaps even because of, the text’s limitations and subsequent disagreements over their correct interpretation, the Visuddhimagga is certain to remain a vital part of the Buddhist Tradition for centuries to come.",

He concludes that people needed a reason to live, a “will to meaning,” as a necessary core of their psychological health, without which survival was impossible. In America, the book became wildly popular for its descriptions of life in the German concentration camps and for its feel-good defense of positive thinking and a generic, rationalized, Judeo-Christian spirituality. Personally, I read Frankl’s anecdotes more as a defense of ethical behavior in the face of death less than as a defense of the imagination and its attachments as he imaged. As he himself points out: those survivors most strongly attached to hope where those most strongly disillusioned by their return. Frankl’s Judeo-Christian lens also prohibited him from engaging in more sober self-analysis in ways that are worth unpacking for what they say about Western culture more broadly. For example, it’s more than a little problematic that Frankl approvingly (!) quotes Nietzsche. In the final analysis, Man’s Search for Meaning remains a complex classic, as much in need of psychoanalysis as it purports to contain it.",

I recommend starting with chapter three (available for free here!) and four and then skipping ahead to the last two chapters because the middle chapters are awful and the first couple simply aren’t important. These four chapters (3, 4, 11, and 12) give you all the meat of the book while sparing you some horrific and unnecessary diversions into e.g. pedophilia. While the monograph exists in written form, I recommend listening to the audiobook. With archival recordings of the original interviews used wherever the book quotes a primary source (or actors where such recordings don’t exist), original music, and narration by, of course, the author himself, the book sounds more like a slick podcast than a scripted robot.

See 99pi’s “Model Organism” for a taste. The book also makes a strong case for being sceptical that we even can engineer our way out of climate change. While it nods to the “but what other choice do we have” counterargument, I hope that readers come away from this tension in the book more confident than ever in our need for decarbonization and I hope that readers won’t leap to even worse ideas than those highlighted in the book, such as fatalism or population control.

        "content": "What is Buddhism? Buddhism is the religion founded by the Buddha in approximately the 5th century BCE in the Ganges River Valley. The Buddha taught that every effect has a cause and he used this idea to solve the problems at the heart of the human condition: death, anxiety, suffering and evil. He discovered that the cause of our spiritual disease is our erroneous perception that we are at the center of things. We are, in every moment, the center of our own experience, and it’s natural that we came to think of ourselves as a real being. But this perspective the Buddha called “ignorance,” and it causes us to suffer when the things we identify with (our body, our career, our relationships, etc) change in ways we dislike or don’t change in the ways we would like. The religion the Buddha founded is the set of contemplations, practices and beliefs which have been discovered to help students overcome their “selfish” tendencies and to attain liberation from the tyranny of “me.” Prerequisites This course assumes English language proficiency. Time Commitment This is a self-paced course, which is estimated to take a few months to complete depending on your reading pace. Course Outline Introduction “There are two conditions for the arising of right view. What two? The words of another and proper attention.” ~ AN 2.126 The Miracle of Mindfulness – Thích Nhất Hạnh (.pdf) (.epub) Before we dive into the nuts and bolts of “Buddhism” proper, let us first explore the emotional experience of the Buddhist way, catching a glimpse of its beauty through the eyes of one of Buddhism’s most celebrated teachers—and one of my favorite books. Start here! Then, listen to these talks by two of my own dear teachers, giving their introduction to Buddhism. Some Dhamma Advice – Ajahn Suchart (.mp3) Introduction to Buddhism – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) What do you notice about these three introductions? What surprised you? What was interesting? Jot down whatever observations and questions you have, and as we go through the course we’ll refer back to these notes. Textbook For those looking for a thorough, academic introduction to Buddhism, I recommend: An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices – Peter Harvey This textbook can be read alongside the course, providing the basic framing for the rest of the course. The class is arranged according to its outline and some of its topics — rituals, history, sects — will not be covered by the other works. The textbook remains, however, optional, as the free materials below provide an excellent overview of the Buddha and his teachings all on their own. Feel free to just read the rest without the “connective tissue” of Harvey’s textbook, though total beginners to Buddhism might well be advised to give the textbook a chance, as its framing and contextualization will be helpful, if somewhat dry. Who was the Buddha? Readings parallel to Chapters 1–2 of Harvey Biography of Shakyamuni Buddha – Ven Master Hsing Yun (.pdf) (.pdf) A deeply human, simple but powerful retelling of the Buddha’s life story from a renowned modern master. My most highly recommended biography of the Buddha. A Secular Introduction to Buddhism – Doug Smith A short introduction to Buddhism from a more secular perspective. SN 22.86: Anuradha Sutta – Joseph Goldstein (.mp3) (.pdf) Who was the Buddha in his own words? In this story, he calls himself the “Tathagata” or “Truth-Arriver”, and he responds to a question on what will become of him after his death. The Buddha explains that he doesn’t talk in such terms, as he has overcome all such notions as “I am the body” or “I am the mind” so how could such a question ever be answered? He ends the discourse by famously saying that all he teaches is suffering and the end of suffering, thus redirecting our attention from empty philosophical musings to the things that matter most. Statue of The Buddha Triumphing Over Mara – Nathan Yoo and Churyl Zeviar A short video explaining the symbolism of an iconic statue depicting the Buddha’s enlightenment. Prayer and Worship – G. P. Malalasekera (.pdf) Contemporary Buddhists do indeed worship the Buddha, but what do they think about when they bow to the Buddha statue? Is it “prayer” when Buddhists chant? What did the Buddha teach? Readings parallel to Ch 3–5 of Harvey The next part of the class tackles the Buddha’s teachings. As this section is the primary focus of the course, it will be the longest. The Buddha and His Dhamma – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) (.epub) This work by Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a brief overview and introduction to Buddhism, summarizing what we learned about the Buddha. How To Be Positive – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) too many people live life as if they’re in a fast car: looking through the window, always going on to the next thing Ajahn Brahm explains how going slow allows us to see the beauty in life and ourselves. Alternative Presentations of the Dhamma Are We Morally Obligated to Meditate? – Samuel Sigal (.pdf) An example of the many popular press articles reporting on the benefits of meditation AN 8.53: In Brief (.pdf) In this early discourse from the Buddhist Canon, the Buddha contextualizes his teachings by listing the character traits that the practice should produce if practiced correctly. Compare this list with the feeling you got from Thich Nhat Hanh and with the benefits described in the popular article above (and any other information you may have read). Do you notice any differences? Similarities? Does anything on this list surprise you? Are these three sources (the sutta, the monk and the media) saying the same thing in different words or has something been “lost in translation”? This discourse is one of the few teachings in the canon (along with the teachings on mindfulness) which the Buddha declared as “categorical”: always applicable and useful in any situation. This sutta gives, better than any other, the overall direction of the teachings, and is a helpful rubric to refer back to. Happiness – Ven Hong Ci (.mp3) Ven Hong Ci invites us to get off the treadmill of pursuing sense pleasures, and to live fully in the present moment, thus tying together the threads from the above: renunciation, mindfulness and fulfilment. What the Buddha Taught – Walpola Rahula (.pdf) The classic introduction to Buddhist philosophy to the modern reader. Walpola Rahula’s book has had a dramatic impact on the shape of Buddhist thought in the West but its interest is far from merely historical: it remains one of the most lucid and sympathetic introductions available in English, even today. Recommended for newcomers to Buddhism or anyone looking for a solid grounding in Buddhist doctrine. The main text for the doctrinal and philosophical content of this course, but don’t worry: it is very well written. The class may breeze through or dwell on this book as short or as long as time and interest permits. SN 42.6: Asibandhaka’s Son (.pdf) One of the hallmarks of Buddhism as a religion is that the Buddha emphatically rejected salvation through faith and prayers alone. In this sutta, the Buddha illustrates this with a humorous simile. Reflection Questions After finishing the above, it’s now a good time to go back to your notes from the introduction and see how your understanding has changed. Have your questions been answered? Is anything that was surprising now obvious? Do any new questions arise for you? Buddhist History and the Mahayana Readings parallel to Chapters 6–7 of Harvey SN 35.238: The Simile of the Vipers (.pdf) Gives some vivid imagery to illustrate the Buddhist outlook on life. The class might take a brief look at Buddhist artwork here and a skilled teacher might explain the relationship between art, metaphor and self-transformation across the Buddhist traditions. (I’ll add such a lecture here if I can find a good one) Mostly this text is included here to note that vivid metaphors have always been a part of Buddhism, even in the oldest texts of the Theravada Tradition. These themes will return vividly at the end of chapter 11 for those reading Harvey. The Practice of Buddhism Readings parallel to Chapters 8–11 Coming down from the clouds, what do these teachings actually mean, and how do we practice them? (Snp 1.8) Karaniya Metta Sutta: The Buddha’s Words on Loving-Kindness (.pdf) A beautiful Discourse, roughly equivalent to the (rightly) much celebrated passage on love in the Christian Bible, 1 Corinthians 13. Notice, though, how the Buddha’s description of love explicitly extends our compassionate circle of concern to all sentient beings. Also, rather than framing the sermon as a description of what love is (“patient, kind” etc) notice how the Buddha instead describes love as a practice, giving us instructions on what “should be done.” This shift away from descriptive philosophy and towards ethical praxis is one of the hallmarks of Buddhism, especially in contrast with Western philosophy. Also, consider reading this passage out loud, remembering that the Buddha’s words were passed down primarily by oral recitation. How does reading it out loud change your experience of the text? Loving Kindness Chant – Abhayagiri Monastery (.mp3) Now, listen to it chanted in the traditional style by a group of monks in California. What benefits do you see in chanting this way, as compared to simply reading the text? The Bodhisattva’s Garland of Jewels – Atiśa Dīpaṃkara (.pdf) This poem from the Mahayana Tradition beautifully and concisely summarizes the heart of Buddhist ethics. Does any of its advice surprise you? Inspire you? Challenge you? On Love – Ajahn Jayasaro (.epub) (.pdf) Ajahn Jayasaro explains how we might apply Buddhist wisdom to an area of our lives we all care deeply about: our relationships. While reading, I encourage you to engage with this text. Think about your own relationships while you read. Is there any wisdom here you can take home with you? Ideally, the chapter on meditation would be accompanied by in-person meditation instruction. I encourage the digital student to seek out a local meditation group at this point if you haven’t done so already to get first-hand experience with this very important part of Buddhist practice if you haven’t already. It’s also a good time to revisit your questions from the introduction one more time. How has engaging with Buddhist practice changed your understanding of the doctrine? What do you make of Buddhism now? Buddhism and Modernity Readings parallel to Chapters 12–13 I supplement the final chapters in Harvey on the recent history of Buddhism with a few essays on the unique cultural challenges and opportunities which Western Buddhists now face: Buddhism and Modernity – Douglas Powers (.pdf) Individualism, science, freedom and morality — four contemporary conversations which Buddhism has much to contribute to Buddhism and Human Flourishing – Peter Harvey (.pdf) A defense of Buddhism in light of some Western critiques and an encouragement to try out one particular Eastern practice. The Science Delusion – Curtis White (.pdf) A provocative essay on thinking more critically about our scientific, materialistic assumptions before we instinctively “reform” Buddhism to conform to them. And Lastly, Khp 5: The Highest Blessings (.pdf) The Highest Blessings Chant – Abhayagiri Monastery (.mp3) The Buddha’s own overview of “the good life” (and a traditional blessing chant) I would like to end the class by offering you this summary of every good blessing. May your life thus be blessed!",

        "content": "What are the Early Buddhist Texts? The Early Buddhist Texts are the subset of the canonical literature of the different Buddhist schools which accurately report the teachings of the historical Buddha. These texts have undergone (indeed, continue to undergo) some revision and contemporary scholarship continues to debate subtle points, but most scholars agree that the Pali Suttas and Chinese Āgamas remain historically reliable witnesses to the Buddha’s life and teachings. Whether they are spiritually reliable, however, is a matter for us to investigate. Prerequisites The Intro to Buddhism course is not a prerequisite for this course. Though some familiarity with Buddhism will be helpful, this course is suitable for serious beginners. Time Commitment This course contains about 80 hours of lectures and reading, depending on how fast you read, and can take anywhere from 2 weeks to a year to finish. For example, 3 lectures (6hr) per week would make this a 15 week course. Course Outline This course gives a thorough introduction to what the Buddha taught in his own words, and also explores how these words came down to us. Introduction Buddha: True Genius – Ajahn Brahmali (.mp3) (.mp3) An introductory lecture by Ajahn Brahmali in which he shares with us his love and enthusiasm for the Buddha’s teachings. To listen to the lecture, just click one of the links above! Textbook In the Buddha’s Words: An Anthology of Discourses from the Pali Canon – Bhikkhu Bodhi The main textbook for this course is the (commercial) work In The Buddha’s Words by Bhikkhu Bodhi. If you cannot obtain a copy of the book, an open-source version can be read online for free at Reading Faithfully, but the real book is preferred for its helpful redactions and notes. This book gives a systematic introduction to the Buddha’s teachings, and will be the primary text for this class. About the Texts As you make your way through ItBW, I encourage you to weave in the following works about the history of the texts you’re studying: The General Introduction to In The Buddha’s Words – Bhikkhu Bodhi Gives a good overview of the oral tradition. Be sure not to skip it! The Buddha as a Teacher – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) In what context and in what way were these teachings delivered? And to what purpose? Vācā: Speech – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) How did the Buddha speak? Early Buddhist Texts – Bhante Sujato and Ajahn Brahmali (.zip) We invite Ajahn Brahmali back, along with our friend (and founder of SuttaCentral) Ajahn Sujato, for a special guest class on the early texts. Early Buddhism: A Conversation with Kalupahana – Richard Payne and David J. Kalupahana (.pdf) (.pdf) On why it’s important to study the early texts. In Search of the Real Buddha – Peter Harvey (.pdf) About the Buddha of the Early Texts compared with the later hagiographies… and our own materialistic assumptions. The Oral Transmission of Early Buddhist Literature – Alexander Wynne (.pdf) Argues against an improvisational oral transmission and shows why we should think of the texts as having been passed down to us (relatively) verbatim Lectures In the Buddha’s Words (Course) – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.MP3s) Bhikkhu Bodhi himself will be your lecturer for this class. Read a chapter of In the Buddha’s Words (hereafter abbreviated as ItBW), and then listen to the lecture associated with that chapter before moving on to the next. Starting with chapter six, however, the content starts to get a bit more challenging and Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lectures start to slow down. You may want to adjust your reading pace accordingly at that point. Office Hours If any questions come up for you that aren’t addressed in the lectures, I recommend searching the SuttaCentral Discourse Forum for something relevant to your question. If you can’t find your question answered in the archives, feel free to post it! There are many knowledgeable scholars and students of Early Buddhism on the forum (including yours truly) and we would be happy to help! One Additional Sutra In addition to the Pāli texts highlighted in ItBW, I recommend the following additional discourse: MA 220: The Discourse on Knowing the Better Way to Catch a Snake (.pdf) This discourse from the Chinese Canon is included to demonstrate how extraordinarily similar the language of the northern Agamas are compared to the language of the Pāli Canon (preserved in Sri Lanka) This sutra is most directly parallel to the Pāli texts presented in ItBW chapter nine on the Five Aggregates and it could be read when you get to that part of the book, or after you’ve finished. Conclusion We end the course with this word of advice: In Line With the Teaching: The Four Appamadas – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo reminds us to not get too bogged down in scholarship, even though some scholarship is necessary, and encourages us to never forget to put into practice what we learn.",

        "content": "What is the Form of Buddhism? The Form of Buddhism is the “religious” side of Buddhism: the history, institutions, rituals and externalities that socially define the religion. Whether Buddhism even is a “religion” at all is, of course, a matter of some controversy. Is it a philosophy? A movement? A practice? An aesthetic? Who even counts as “a Buddhist”? In defining the bounds of “who is Buddhist”, some “middle way” may be desirable, between: The conservative, “prescriptive” definition (The Buddha once said that only enlightened beings count as his followers!) And the completely liberal, “historical” definition (The Buddha’s life has materially impacted everything from ancient trade routes, to Islamic art, Christian conflicts, IKEA designs, software engineering practices… nearly every human life today.) In searching for such a middle way, I take on Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of Religion here, and say that “Religion is whatever you take seriously.” The forms of Buddhism, then, are the various ways that people have looked back to the Buddha for guidance and inspiration, and the many ways they have found to reshape their lives in response to what they’ve seen. Prerequisites This course assumes familiarity with the fundamentals of Buddhism, but no worries if you’re rusty: you’ll get a refresher below. Course Outline This course proceeds in three parts: history, community, and practice. The history portion of the course is the longest and describes the entire history of Buddhism. The second section analyzes this history to highlight the role of the monastic community, and the third section zooms all the way in to the individual practices. Introduction On forms and the formless. On Science Religion and Culture – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.pdf) (.pdf) Here we get Bhante Yuttadhammo’s definition of religion which I referenced earlier, and his introductory thoughts on the cultural forms of Buddhism. What Buddhism Offers – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo then gives us his thoughts on the essence of Buddhism. Sourcebook Throughout this course, we’ll be using a Common Buddhist Text as our primary source: Common Buddhist Text: Guidance and Insight from the Buddha (.pdf) An anthology from the canons of the Three Vehicles, giving us a taste of the canonical literature from the various traditions. Selections will be referenced like this: [CBT] L.59 For example, this refers to the passage in Common Buddhist Text about Ven Vaṅgīsa which contains a poem in praise of the Buddha. To look up the passage, search the PDF or skim the Table of Contents for the reference number (“L.59”). This passage, for example, is on page 84 of the above pdf (note: page numbers differ in the printed editions). Part 1: The Sociology and History of Buddhism Textbooks There are two textbooks for this first part of the course: The Buddhist Religion: A Historical Introduction – Richard Robinson, Willard L. Johnson, and Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro The main textbook for this part, Robinson will give us an accessible and enjoyable survey of Buddhism’s long history across Asia and beyond. Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought – Ven Pategama Gnanarama (.pdf) A more theoretical text, Gnanarama will provide an introduction to how Buddhists themselves thought about the sociology of religion. Feel free to skip the readings from this book if you’re not as interested in theory. Introduction Let us start off by reading Chapter 1 (“Towards a Definition”) of Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought to round off our discussion of how Buddhism can be defined as a “religion” and how it may relate to other concepts you’ve heard of. I Wonder Why – Ven Thubten Chodron (.pdf) For a refresher on the basics of Buddhism, I recommend skimming this Q&amp;A with Thubten Chodron before we dive into the more detailed history below. There’s no need to read it thoroughly: just read the answers to whatever questions interest you. Supplementary Material to Robinson As you read through Robinson et al’s Historical Introduction one chapter at a time, please also consider: Parallel to Robinson Ch 1: Awakening The Buddha You Never Knew – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) The Buddha was a real, historical figure, but many of the stories about his life are myths still expanding today. [CBT] L.7–17 Here we get the Buddha’s spiritual journey in his own words. Notice the repetitive nature of the early, oral texts. Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought) Chapter 2: Dhamma, Medicine and Sociology This chapter introduces us to the central metaphor of Buddhism as a medical science, and the social implications of that framing. Parallel to Robinson Ch 2: Teacher Early Buddhist History – Bhante Sujato and Ajahn Brahmali (.zip) An Introduction to Buddhist History Ancestral Stupas of Shwedagon – U Win Maung (Tampawaddy) (.pdf) “Stupas” are mentioned as sites of worship even in the earliest texts and archeology as the burial sites of great leaders. This paper shows what those looked like, from ancient India to modern Burma. The Symbolism of the Early Stūpa – Peter Harvey (.pdf) They’re beautiful, aren’t they? But what do they mean? The Buddhist Wheel Symbol – T. B. Karunaratne (.pdf) (.epub) While the Christians have the cross and the Jews the star, the Buddhists have the wheel as the symbol of their religion. But where did this wheel come from and what does it mean? [CBT] Th.13, L.25, Th.205, L.23, L.30, L.34, L.39, L.42, L.53, L.57, Th.28, Th.59, Th.73–75, Th.98, Th.116, Th.171 Here we get a few stories about the Buddha’s life as a teacher from the early texts. Aspects (of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought) Chapter 3: Significance of Buddhist Chanting Even in the Buddha’s time, monks would recite the teachings verbatim to acclimate to them and keep them in mind. Over time, this chanting became seen as apotropaic and was therefore ritualized quite early on. Today, chanting features prominently across Buddhist traditions and practices. Parallel to Robinson chapter 3: “Development” Assertion and Restraint in Dhamma Transmission in Early Pāli Sources – Graham Dixon (.pdf) Buddhism is not an especially evangelical religion. This paper explores the unique (compared to other religions) way that Buddhism spread. Venerated Objects and Symbols of Early Buddhism – Peter Harvey (.pdf) The early Buddhists of ancient India did not represent the Buddha with anthropomorphic statues as is ubiquitous now. This essay explores the symbols and objects that were venerated in the early period after the Buddha’s death. The Lotus as a Symbol in the Pali Tradition – Carl Olson (.pdf) (.pdf) One such object which became notably ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures is the lotus flower. This article explores the ancient origins and meaning of this potent symbol. A Teaching on the Offering of Flowers – Jigme Tenpe Nyima (.pdf) And this essay commends the virtues of offering flowers: a lovely practice still common across Buddhist Asia [CBT] M.5, Th.94 Buddhists lament the passing of their teacher and build monuments in his memory. [CBT] Th.157 This verse was especially popular to carve on early monuments to the Buddha. [CBT] Th.217 An account of the first council of the Buddha’s disciples after his death, at which the teachings were first codified. [CBT] M.14 In praise of the Sutras, preserved after the Buddha’s death. [CBT] M.36, M.38 On the practice of giving to the Sangha in order to transfer merit to one’s deceased relatives: a practice that became common in the years after the Buddha. [CBT] M.96 On the practice of releasing animals for merit, a tradition now found across the Buddhist world. Aspects Chapter 5 (we’ll come back to 4 later): Buddhist Art Symbols For Religious Edification Art, offerings and other public devotions provided early (and current) Buddhists with an effective, yet soft, way to spread the religion. Chapter 4: “The Rise of Mahayana” Arahants, Bodhisattvas, and Buddhas – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) In this essay, Bhikkhu Bodhi explores the Bodhisattva ideal from the perspective of the Theravada and Mahayana. [CBT] Th.210 The description of reality as perceived by an awakened being in the early texts became the basis for much speculation about the nature of reality after the Buddha’s passing [CBT] M.143, M.16, M.111–112 (note: M.112 is mislabeled “M.114”) Nirvana came to be identified as being the same as ultimate reality, and as the essential nature of the mind. [CBT] M.44, M.61, M.103, M.137 “Emptiness”—also present in early Buddhism—was deployed to counter this essentializing tendency. [CBT] M.62, M.142 This eventually led to a “Middle Way” synthesis of these philosophical extremes. Aspects Chapter 4 (as promised): Aesthetics Aesthetics was actually a major point of departure for the Early Mahayana, who rejected the cold austerity of the Abhidhamma in favor of more beautiful expressions of enlightened wisdom. Chapter 5: “The Pantheon” The Karma-Vibhanga Reliefs at Borobudur – Bhikkhu Ānandajoti (.pdf) In the centuries after the Buddha, many of the subtleties of karma were simplified for didactic expedience. This led to a formulaic, “if you do this, this will happen to you” understanding of karma (which the Buddha himself rejected as fatalistic) that came to be repeated ad-infinitum in texts (such as the Karma-Vibanga) and in Buddhist art (such as, here, at Borobudur) for millennia, perpetuating a (mis)understanding of Karma which has persisted to today. The Abduction of Queen Kakati – Kit Patrick (.mp3) But, as Buddhism became more popular and spread around and out of India, it also picked up an artistic and mythological richness that textured and enlivened the tradition. Indeed, Buddhism’s ability to embrace and contextualize local mythology has long been a key to its ability to spread peacefully. The story behind this ancient, Buddhist statue. Narratives of Buddhist Relics and Images – Stephen C. Berkwitz (.pdf) Such foreign converts often yearned for a solid connection back to the Buddha. One common expression of this was the creation and authentication of local “souvenirs” which also play a prominent role in popular Buddhism to this day. The True Dhamma Has Disappeared – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) In addition to new relics and stories explaining them, many new teachings were also introduced. Today, as all the remaining traditions have picked up their fair share of shady teachers, deity cults, and doctrinal confusion, Ajahn Geoff reminds us that we have to be discerning about where we place our faith. Aspects Chapter 6: Socialization for Death What effect does Buddhism’s encouragement to reflect on death and impermanence have on how Buddhists perceive the cosmos, life, and the religion itself? [CBT] M.73, V.33, M.56–57, M.49, M.91, M.67, M.99 Practitioners came to be encouraged to aspire to Buddhahood themselves and to take the Bodhisattva Path rather than to take the “lesser” path of the disciple so as to maximize the benefit that their enlightenment can have for others. [CBT] M.68 Role models, guides, and supporters are crucial for this Bodhisattva Path. [CBT] M.55 Thankfully, there are advanced Bodhisattvas living now as gods who can be called upon to support you on your journey. [CBT] M.144, M.6 Even the Buddha himself came to be immortalized as a quasi-god. [CBT] M.107, M.154 If the Buddha isn’t truly gone, then that means all the Buddhas of the past are also still out there, making them nearly indistinguishable from the advanced, heavenly Bodhisattvas. [CBT] M.158 We can even aspire to be reborn in one of those “Buddha fields” where a Buddha is currently teaching, which promises a fast track to enlightenment. [CBT] M.129 This all eventually came to mirror Hinduism so closely that this sutra directly equates the Buddha with Brahma and the Buddhists with the Brahmins. After Chapter 6 of Robinson on “Vajrayana” Mudra: What Do Buddhist Hand Gestures Mean? (.pdf) Taking an important role during the later development of Buddhist art and esoterica, mudras such as the “Anjali” of respect are now ubiquitous in the Buddhist cultural sphere, and are nearly synonymous with Buddhism itself. The Story of the Horse-King and the Merchant Siṃhala, in Buddhist Texts – Naomi Appleton (.pdf) One story, five countries. Shows how each nation where Buddhism spread adapted the Indic mythology to explain their own local conditions, and gives us a fascinating window into the spread of Buddhism across Asia. [CBT] Th.208 The early textual basis for equating enlightenment with a “diamond-like” mind. [CBT] M.11, M.17, V.3, M.22, M.42, V.23, V.30, V.38, V.43, M.106, M.114, M.147–149 A few selections from the Vajrayana Canon showing its last developments in India. Aspects Chapter 7: Social Conflict A short essay on the Buddhist understanding of conflict See also, [CBT] Th.17–20 Parallel to Robinson’s Regional Chapters As we transition to more contemporary forms of Buddhism, let us set aside Aspects of Early Buddhist Sociological Thought for now, and consider the contemporary, lived traditions. While not representative of the diversity within each of the following “national” forms, I hope that the texts and clips below capture something of their beauty. Robinson Chapter 7: Sri Lanka Bojjhanga Suttas – Dhammaruwan (.mp3) (.pdf) First, we have this extraordinary recording of a boy in Sri Lanka spontaneously remembering how he chanted Pāli in a past life. [CBT] Th.31 The ideal of the “Righteous Monarch” was hugely influential in the Theravada world and continues to justify monarchy in Thailand today. [CBT] Th.215 The Theravada monks, meanwhile, hold up Sariputta as their ideal: the wise, analytical follower of the Buddha. [CBT] Th.90–91, Th.146, Th.159 The Theravadin philosophical tradition loves to break Dharmas into exact parts and definitions. [CBT] Th.135, Th.152, Th.145 The Theravada is also famous for its “morbid” meditations on pain and death. [CBT] Th.52, Th.108 But Theravada isn’t all bleak, as they also celebrate the beauty of the Dhamma and of good companionship. [CBT] Th.194 Very conservative in their practice of the monastic rules, Theravada monks still go on alms round and abstain from eating dinner to this day. [CBT] Th.117, Th.172, Th.181, Th.196, Th.226 Lastly, we read Theravada responses to some Mahayana ideas. Robinson Chapter 8: China Drums and Bells – Qing De Monastery (.mp3) A monk at a lonely temple, deep in the mountains of Taiwan, says goodbye to the day with drum and bell. [CBT] Th.41, M.115 The Confucian social values of ancient China found a natural counterpart in certain early Buddhist teachings, which came to be emphasized. [CBT] Th.50, M.34 Here, for example, we compare the earlier (Theravada) perspective on honoring one’s parents with the Chinese perspective. [CBT] M85–86 Yet there were some real innovations, such as the Chinese Buddhist embrace of vegetarianism. [CBT] Th.218, M.14 Notice here how sutras and scholarship themselves came to be objects of worship. [CBT] M.165 The Chan/Zen school, however, rejected this new focus on texts, and claimed an authority based on a transmission “outside” the Sutras. [CBT] M.80 They advocated a wise, flexible ethics not slavishly devoted to following monastic rules. [CBT] M.127 And a “direct, non-conceptual” experience of the truth,opposed to the mere “verbal” Dharma of the sutras. [CBT] M.31 Both these traditions (the scholarly and Chan) went through periods of patronage and persecution, which left a lasting lesson on the impermanence of fame immortalized in poetry such as this. [CBT] M.167 We end our section on China by reading this very famous story about the Sixth Patriarch of the Chan School. Robinson Chapter 9: Korea and Vietnam Images and Monasteries in Faxian’s Account on Anurādhapura – Haewon Kim (.pdf) What does a Chinese monk’s pilgrimage to Sri Lanka have to do with Korea? [CBT] M.18, M.26, M.78, M.108, M.118, M.149 The Vietnamese and Korean traditions have taken on a more “engaged” attitude towards Awakening and the Bodhisattva path. Korean Buddhist Art A Korean nun demonstrates the Buddhist spirit of generosity. Robinson Chapter 10: Japan Introduction to Buddhist Art – Doug Smith From the iconic period to the modern day in a few minutes. A very short introduction to Buddhist Art. [CBT] M.27, M.102 Japanese Buddhists are famous for their patient austerity. [CBT] M.81 Yet they often have a rather lenient attitude towards e.g. alcohol. [CBT] M.105, M.159 A Bodhisattva can make vows to delay their awakening in order to construct an elaborate and appealing “Buddha field” into which their followers may be reborn. Here we read the vows of the Buddha Amitabha, whose worship is especially popular in Japanese Buddhism. [CBT] M.39, M.74 And here we read about the vast array of Buddha fields across the ocean-like multiverse and how to attain rebirth in one. [CBT] M.156 On the other hand, all such notions (even up to enlightenment itself) are in fact empty, and there is actually nothing to attain. Amida Buddha: The Central Symbol of Pure Land Buddhism – Alfred Bloom (.pdf) In this way, we can understand Pure Land Buddhism at multiple levels: the mythic, the psychological, and the non-dual. Robinson Chapter 11: Tibet Right View, Red Rust, and White Bones: A Reexamination of Buddhist Teachings on Female Inferiority – Allison Goodwin (.pdf) Now that we’ve covered all the “traditional” forms of Buddhism, we can take a closer look at one particular element of cultural Buddhism that has been surprisingly ubiquitous across Buddhist cultures: misogyny. Allison Goodwin gives a brief outline of the discrimination faced by women in Buddhism, and a thoroughly cited argument for rejecting sexist views, even those that appear in the Buddhist Canon. [CBT] V.47 How to help others, including the place for supernormal powers. [CBT] V.22 The Dharma is not an impermanent thing. [CBT] V.70 A passage from the “Tibetan Book of the Dead” on the nature of mind. [CBT] V.71–73 On the three kinds of knowledge. Philosophy in general, and epistemology in particular, is highly valued in Tibetan Buddhism. [CBT] V.78 Ultimate knowledge is, however, non-dual. [CBT] M.168, V.80 Tibetan Buddhism is (in)famous for its worldly teachers. These passages describe one such role model for the engaged Bodhisattva. [CBT] V.91 Exuberant guru and deity worship are also notable features of Tibetan Buddhism. Seven Line Prayer of Guru Rinpoche – Ani Choying Drolma Here is a beautiful rendition of a popular Guru invocation, sung by a Tibetan Nun. Aspects (of Buddhist Sociological Thought) Chapter 8: Women’s Social Role We (finally) return to Aspects’ final chapter for a look at how the Buddha originally taught women. Robinson Chapter 12: “Buddhism Comes West” [CBT] Th.23, Th.25, Th.26, Th.47, Th.104, Th.118, Th.129, Th.155, Th.203, Th.207 Western, “Protestant” Buddhists have selected certain strands from the early Canon to emphasize. Here, we read some of their favorite passages. Altruism in Classical Buddhism – Todd Lewis (.pdf) A brief look back at Altruism, and one tiny example of Western Philosophy grappling with Buddhism. Bridging the Two Vehicles – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.mp3) As the Dhamma comes West, and globalization connects us all, we have a unique opportunity now to bridge the gaps that history and geography created… but only if we choose to do so. And with that, we’re now finished with Part 1 of our course! History is now yours to make! Part 2: The Sangha Zooming in slightly from the historical perspective, we next turn our attention to the dynamics of individual Buddhist communities. Introduction End of the Buddhist Utopia – Bhante Sujato (.mp3) Bhante Sujato starts by asking why Buddhism died out in India, and what factors will lead to the end of our own (present day) “Buddhist Utopia” SN 45.2: Good Friendship – Joseph Goldstein (.mp3) Joseph Goldstein reads the Buddha’s own take on “the entire spiritual life.” Going Forth – Ajahn Viradhammo (.pdf) A beautiful sermon on the value of monasticism. The Art of Making Buddha Statues: Cultivation – Dharma Realm Buddhist Association A video about a community coming together to make ten thousand Buddha statues by hand. The Economy of Gifts – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro Thanissaro Bhikkhu explains the relationship between the monastic sangha and the laity in brief. We Love Our Nuns: Affective Dimensions of the Sri Lankan Bhikkhunī Revival – Susanne Mrozik (.pdf) A paper on how the flourishing of the monastic community affects everyone around them. [CBT] Th.54, Th.85–88, Th.105 Good friendship is vital on the path to Awakening. [CBT] Th.79 The Sangha are not priests. Buddhist monks cannot purify you, only you can purify you. [CBT] M.89, Th.95 Still, you should receive the precepts from someone keeping them, and monks and nuns across the Buddhist world chant protective blessings for their lay supporters. [CBT] Th.190 The lay and monastic communities are vital to the support of each other. Main Text A Culture of Awakening – Bhikkhu Cintita (.pdf) The Monastic Sangha is both training ground and dwelling place for the Noble Sangha, much like a university is both a training ground and a dwelling place for scholars. Given the thousands of years separating us from the Buddha, Bhikkhu Cintita asks the excellent question of how it is that Buddhism has survived so well across time and cultures, and then uses this theory to ponder how modern, Western practitioners should approach this question of “Sasana.” An excellent and rare introduction to the sociology of Buddhism “from the inside,” this book is a must-read. [CBT] Th.191, Th.204 The core of the Sangha is the Ariya Sangha: those disciples who have attained awakening themselves. As long as they are present, and the community meets in harmony, the Dharma will thrive. Coda The History of Buddhist Monasticism and Its Western Adaptation – Bhikshuni Karma Lekshe Tsomo (.pdf) Buddhist monasticism faces many challenges as it comes West, especially for nuns. Healing is Possible in Every Moment – Thích Nhất Hạnh (.mp3) An inspiring talk to a group of monastics, encouraging them to set a good example for their guests, showing how there need not be such a strict tension between personal practice and social engagement. Part 3: Personal Practice The last third of our class tackles the more prescriptive, “micro” question of our own, individual practice: What should one do to be a Buddhist? Textbook Lay Buddhist Practice: The Shrine Room, Uposatha Day, Rains Residence – Laurence Khantipalo Mills (.pdf) (.epub) A straightforward and practical guide, this book gives detailed descriptions and explanations for the most important religious practices for lay Buddhists. Good reading for anthropologists of Buddhism, for those who have recently converted, or those who are thinking about it, this book is absolutely essential and remains my first recommendation for learning how to be a Buddhist. [CBT] Th.39–40, Th.49, Th.96, Th.112, Th.114 The Buddha’s description of (/prescription for) “the good life” for a householder. [CBT] Th.228, M.162 Citta the Householder shows what is possible for laypeople to achieve. Supplements We have two supplements for Khantipalo: Taking Refuge Listen to this alongside the section of Khantipalo about refuge and the triple gem: Becoming Buddhist – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.m4a) Bhante Yuttadhammo talks about what it means to be a Buddhist, and how to think about “taking refuge” [CBT] Th.89, Th.93, M.82 The path starts with faith. Practicing Restraint A few more words are also due on the subject of restraint, beyond the five precepts. Please consider this alongside the section on “practice” SN 35.239: The Simile of the Chariot (.pdf) Explains the three primary duties of a monk: guarding the senses, moderation in eating, and the devotion to wakefulness. What monastic behaviors and vows do you know about already? How do the monastic and “eight precept” observances help with these three duties? What do you think is their benefit? Can lay Buddhists practice these? Should they? [CBT] Th.21, Th.102, Th.122 On wholesome and unwholesome actions of body, speech, and mind. [CBT] M.109, M.124 On how to use meditation as an antidote to greed, hatred, and restlessness. [CBT] V.55–56 Does this admonishment to practice solitude contrast with the emphasis on the spiritual community we read earlier? How do you explain this tension? Praxis Conclusion Dhammavinaya – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo revisits the Gotami Sutta (which you may remember from the Intro to Buddhism Course) and tells us how we can recognize when our own practice of Buddhism goes off track. [CBT] V.52, V.54 No matter what happens: never give up. Conclusion to the Class [CBT] Th.24 The purpose of learning is to calm the mind. Pseudo-Buddhism – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) Ajahn Brahm, in his light-hearted way, comments on the above verse. Why Forms Are Fundamental to Buddhist Practice – Koun Franz (.pdf) What form will your practice take? The “Sangye tenpa…” Dedication – Longchen Rabjampa (.pdf) It’s common in many Buddhist cultures to end a meritorious event or auspicious occasion with a short dedication. Here is a typical such prayer from the Tibetan Tradition.",

        "content": "What is the Function of Buddhism? The Function of Buddhism is to make us happy by supporting our cultivation of virtue, mental clarity, and wisdom. Buddhism supports this “threefold training” by providing both essential, explanatory frameworks and practical guidance. The Buddha himself called this a “Dhamma-Vinaya,” or “Philosophy-Discipline,” but we might simply call it “a way of life” because Buddhism is meant to transform our entire lives from our selfish, restless, addicted, never-satisfied “default mode,”1 to the pinnacle of human potential—the total eradication of suffering. Prerequisites This course strives to be a rigorous overview of Buddhism suitable for everyone—from beginners to experienced practitioners alike—and it is recommended for all. For a softer introduction to Buddhism, see Buddhism 101. Course Outline I am satisfied that this course is both rigorous and accurate without compromising its lofty subject. Main Text This course follows the excellent textbook by Bhikkhu Cintita: Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path – Bhikkhu Cintita (.pdf) A gradual guide into the heart of Buddhism. Introduction This book is divided into two, unsurprising halves: Buddhist Life and Buddhist Path. These two divisions roughly follow the exterior and interior transformation of the practitioner, and also follows the gradual explanation of Buddhism, from the mundane to the transcendent, often used by the Buddha himself. Going Forth – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) In this talk, Bhante Yuttadhammo gives us an overview of these two halves of Buddhism, and gives us a preview of what to expect in this course. To start the class, simply click on the link above and listen! When you’re done, come back here and keep reading to continue with the course. Lectures Bhante Yuttadhammo will be our lecturer for this class. The Los Angeles Course – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3s) His Los Angeles Talks were originally delivered to yogis practicing his meditation technique (which I highly recommend), and thus has a different style than Bhikkhu Cintita’s more staid textbook, despite covering (approximately) the same material. I have reordered and renumbered the lectures in Google Drive according to the chapters in “Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path” that they best correspond with: 00 - Three Trainings (2009-03-16).mp3 This first lecture, to listen to before starting the book, explains the three-fold training which I mentioned in my definition. 01 - Wrong View (2009-03-28).mp3 This lecture should be listened to after reading chapter 1 and its supplements (below). and so on… Please listen to them in this order, not chronologically. Supplementary Readings To get some diversity of voices, and to enrich our understanding, we supplement each chapter in Buddhist Life with some additional words. Please read the following after each chapter: Part 1: Buddhist Life Chapter 1 Craving and Dukkha – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) (Which references The Medical Analogy of the Four Noble Truths by Louis De La Vallée Poussin) We notice here that the Four Noble Truths parallel a medical diagnosis. In this way, we can think of the Buddha as the great “Spiritual Doctor” and his Dhamma as “medicine” which cures our spiritual ills. (Remember at this point to go and listen to lecture number 1.) Chapter 2 For “homework,” please read chapter two of Buddhist Life and: Giving money away makes us happy. Then why do so few of us do it? – Christian Smith and Hilary Davidson (.pdf) the vast majority of Americans (97 percent) are forfeiting the chance to enhance their well-being by practicing real generosity with their money. Generosity First – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) …when these people meditate they’re awfully grim. Ajahn Geoff reminds Westerners to ground their meditation practice in generosity. Enlightenment is the Highest Happiness – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) The Buddha taught us how to be happy: not by chasing after it but by giving. (And then “attend” lecture number 2 here.) Homework for Chapter 3 The Five Precepts – Bhante Jayasara (.mp3) Guard our Senses and Live a Happier Life – Ven Hong Ci (.mp3) AN 3.78: Precepts and Observances (.pdf) (Lecture 3) Chapter 4 ‘Others will be cruel, but here we will not be cruel.’ ~ MN8 Putting Cruelty First – Judith Shklar (.pdf) In this essay, Judith Shklar (not a Buddhist) ponders the implications of placing cruelty first (as the Buddha did). She shows how this position stands at odds with both Christian piety and neoliberal apathy and carves out a more realistic humanism than either extreme. AN 7.6: Wealth (.pdf) Mendicants, there are these seven kinds of wealth. What seven? The wealth of faith, ethical conduct, conscience, prudence, learning, generosity, and wisdom. Chapter 5 Dealing with Difficult People – Ajahn Brahm (.pdf) Ajahn Brahm gives a talk on how to achieve harmony in real life, where we all-too-often meet difficult people. Chapter 6 Stages of Enlightenment (.pdf) A small chart summarizing the four stages of enlightenment mentioned in this chapter. These stages will come up again in more detail later. Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya on Spiritual Companionship A short selection of suttas by Bhikkhu Bodhi, containing the basic instructions on how to wisely find and attend to spiritual friends and teachers. AN3.26: “And what kind of person is to be associated with, followed, and served?” AN4.32: “These are the four means of sustaining a favorable relationship.” AN6.51: “How does a mendicant get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before?” AN5.151: “Someone with these five qualities is able to enter the sure path” This external factor, namely good spiritual friendship, is the final (and most important) of the external factors supporting the Buddhist Path, and so concludes our discussion of “Buddhist Life” and enters us onto the path itself. Part 2: Buddhist Path Having come to the halfway point of our course, one might rightly question what makes Buddhism so different from other religions? Sure, Buddhism “puts cruelty first” and has lots of handy lists, but so far “be generous and don’t do evil” sounds like pretty standard Religious Wisdom™️, no? And that is somewhat accurate of what we’ve covered so far. Buddhism claims no exclusivity on teaching the good life. What Buddhism does uniquely have is the path beyond suffering. For, no matter how rich and privileged you are, no matter how nice and kind and even saintly you become, even the best life still has its ups and downs. As the Buddha explained: “What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from killing living creatures, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?” “It has both pleasure and pain.” “What do you think, Udāyī? On an occasion when someone refrains from stealing … sexual misconduct … lying, is their self perfectly happy at that time, or does it have both pleasure and pain?” “It has both pleasure and pain.” ~ From MN 79 In part II, we finally turn to the Noble Eightfold Path, and the transcendant teachings. Chapter 7 Buddhism: The Only Real Science – Ajahn Brahm (.pdf) Ajahn Brahm reassures us that Buddhism is scientific and rational, containing things that we can discover and prove in ourselves. How Meditation Can Reshape Our Brains – Sara Lazar A neuroscientist talks about the subjective benefits of meditation and how they correlate with changes in the brain. MN 24: Rathavinīta Sutta (Prepared Chariots) (.pdf) Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta teaches Venerable Sāriputta about the Buddha’s path of purification, explaining that the purification of ethics and mind are not the goal, but are rather stages of the path to it. Rathavinīta Sutta – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) Bhikkhu Analayo summarizes and discusses this sutta in this short article. Chapter 8 AN 10.61: (The Fuel for) Ignorance The Buddha explains what fuel keeps ignorance going, and fuels the path out. SN 22.101: The Adze Handle Simile – Joseph Goldstein (.mp3) (.text) Liberation is for one who knows and sees the origin and passing away of the aggregates, and it happens as the natural result of cultivating the Noble Eightfold Path. Interestingly, right intention is not the desire to attain liberation, and the desire for liberation doesn’t lead to liberation. Rather, cultivating renunciation, goodwill and harmlessness, and developing the mind accordingly, is the motivation that leads to nibbāna. While it’s impossible to know “today I’ve made this much progress” it is possible over larger time spans to reflect and see how our practice has changed our character. Becoming Your Own Therapist – Thubten Yeshe (.pdf) A short series of talks and Q-and-As on Buddhist wisdom by a modern Tibetan master. Chapter 9 For most of us, what holds us back from perfecting virtue and becoming saintly ourselves is our fears and our worldly attachments. Bhikkhu Cintita skirted the emotionally charged side of this, but Bhante Yuttadhammo meets it directly in these provocative talks. Dhp 25: The Monk (.pdf) This inspiring set of verses, the penultimate of the Dhammapada, outlines the contours of the holy life and encourages us to dedicate ourselves diligently to the path. Chapter 10 In which we finally get to meditation! Mental cultivation (meditation) in Buddhism – Kedar Nath Dwivedi (.pdf) A short brief in a psychiatric journal summarizing the psychotherapeutic potential of Buddhist meditation. Instructions to Insight Meditation – Mahāsi Sayadaw (.pdf) A general introduction to meditation, these instructions are applicable to whatever meditation technique you do. Essentially: note whenever your mind wanders, and then gently return your awareness back to the body, trying to maintain a continuity of awareness as much as possible. Psychological Aspects of Theravāda Buddhist Meditative Training: Cultivating an I-less Self – Peter Harvey (.pdf) An academic introduction to the purpose and styles of Buddhist meditation. Sensual Pleasures are Painful – Ajahn Suchart (.pdf) One of my favorite talks by my own teacher, Ajahn Suchart, which beautifully sums up the path, encouraging us all to strive for a real, lasting happiness. Chapter 11 Dependant Liberation – Ajahn Brahmali (.pdf) Ajahn Brahmali explains how ethics and meditation naturally lead to enlightenment. AN 11.2: Make a Wish – Ajahn Sucitto (.mp3) (.text) This sutta makes the same point: If one merely focuses on ethics, and becomes consummate in ethics, the path to liberation unfolds on its own. Chapter 12 The Fundamentals of Buddhism – Ajahn Paññavaddho (.pdf) (.mp3) A transcript of a conversation with Ajahn Panyavaddho. Beyond being a nice recap of what we’ve covered in the course, I feel something of the wisdom and compassion of enlightenment coming through in the light-hearted sincerity of this exchange Iti 93: Fires (.pdf) And lastly, a short poem on enlightenment from the Canon. Conclusion Escape to Reality – Ananda Pereira (.pdf) (.epub) A rousing collection of essays on Buddhist wisdom and an earnest appeal to put the teachings into practice. This Opportunity – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo closes the course by encouraging us to make the most of our precious human life: do good, avoid evil, and purify your mind. Footnotes: Here, by “default mode” I refer to what David Foster Wallace called our “natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self.” Neuroscientists have even identified a spinning, vortex of related regions in the middle of the brain which they think is responsible for this self-centered processing, which they have dubbed the “Default Mode Network.” &#8617;",

        "content": "What is Buddhist Ethics? Buddhist Ethics is the training in virtuous conduct beloved by the Noble Ones. Its core principle is non-cruelty: the abstaining from all intentional harm. The most gross forms of cruelty are the ethical precepts common to all Buddhists and to most other religions besides: the renunciation of killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, and intoxication. The Buddha’s instructions, however, continue far beyond such perennial philosophy: to guarding the senses, the development of positive moral character, and (eventually) to the complete eradication of the underlying tendencies towards greed, hatred and delusion which cause cruelty in the first place. The Buddha’s teachings on how to live thus outline a system of transformation which is aimed at awakening — powerful tools for us to use to transform our habits of body, speech, and mind so that they might both afford and accord with liberating insight. Prerequisites Prior familiarity with Buddhism will be helpful but is not necessary for this course. Textbooks There are two textbooks for this class: one dry and one wet. An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues – Peter Harvey This classic textbook covers a surprising breadth of subjects and perspectives in Buddhist Ethics in admirably clear and precise prose. It will supply the “dry” explanations for this course. You can think of Harvey as our lecturer: elucidating the meaning and providing a solid grounding for our course. Our “wet” textbook is the Sanskrit classic: The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: A Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life – Śāntideva This epic poem on grasping firmly the intention to awaken has inspired many generations of Buddhists (myself included) to live a more ethical and spiritual life and it captures beautifully the aesthetic of Buddhist ethics. Well worth reading again and again and again. There are a few English translations of this classic of world literature. Steven Bachelor has a translation available online here for free, but I strongly recommend the Padmakara translation published by Shambhala in 2011 for its unparalleled accuracy and force. Course Outline What Work Is – Philip Levine Forget you. This is about waiting A poem which shakes ‘work’ from its masculine frame and recenters it, not on you, on your brother. We start the course with this poem by American poet Philip Levine. Go ahead and click the link above now to read the poem. Think about its last line. What is work? Hopefully this course will help you answer that question. Part 1: Foundations AN 5.172: Assured A lay follower living at home with these five qualities is self-assured. The core of Buddhist Ethics is summed up well in this pithy sutta. The five qualities listed here are called “The Five Precepts” and all Buddhists strive to preserve them. Technically, observing these five moral precepts assiduously is sufficient to be considered an ethical person. If Buddhist Ethics can be summarized so quickly, why a whole course? What challenges do you see in trying to observe these Five Precepts? What are some issues they don’t cover? Chapter 1: The Shared Foundations of Buddhist Ethics The course will follow the sequence of the chapters in Harvey’s Introduction. Go ahead and read Chapter 1 now, and when you’re finished consider this: PTSD in the Slaughterhouse (.pdf) If you make your living off immorality, it takes a huge toll on your mind, relationships, and health. What the Buddha Would Not Do: According to the Bāhitika-sutta and its Madhyama-āgama Parallel – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) What kinds of things do liberated beings never do? And why not? Smoking and the Fifth Precept – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) Bhante Dhammika demonstrates Buddhist ethical thought for us by examining the question of smoking within—and beyond—the framework of the five precepts. Early Buddhist Ethics – Bhante Sujato and Ajahn Brahmali (.zip) A lecture introducing Buddhist Ethics, particularly from the perspective of early Buddhism. Part 2: Cultivating Virtue The Cultivation of Virtue in Buddhist Ethics – Charles Fink (.pdf) Buddhist ethics corresponds to a more generic, act-centered virtue ethics. In this half of the course, we focus on the cultivation of virtue. What mental states make virtue? What beliefs enable such virtuous mental states? To help us explore these questions, we’ll turn to the Tibetan Tradition’s favorite poem: The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra: A Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life – Śāntideva This entire half of the course technically covers only Chapter 2 of Harvey but really centers on The Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra. A free version is linked above, but there are a number of better (copyrighted) translations available, including the Padmakara edition published by Shambhala. Buddhist Ethics and the Bodhicaryāvatāra – Jay Garfield Philosopher Jay Garfield talks about how he got into Buddhism from Western philosophy and shares with us what he finds so compelling about this particular text. His lectures on the book compliment this course extremely well and are recommended alongside the material listed below. They can be purchased online here. Your chosen translation of the text may have a good introduction and, if so, you may want to read that now. But if not, this introduction is good for our purposes: Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism – Charles Goodman (.pdf) An encyclopedia entry on Indian and Tibetan Buddhism which lays the groundwork for our reading of this beloved classic. With that by way of introduction, let’s now read Śāntideva himself! Preferably twice! Seriously, it’s that good. Your first time, I recommend reading it all the way through. Let the poetic language, imagery and structure work their magic on you. After reading it once for feel, go back and reread the book chapter-by-chapter with the additional readings below to put the work into dialogue with the Theravāda tradition. The Way of the Bodhisattva Chapter 1: The Excellence of Bodhicitta In Buddhism, the highest good is awakening, and in this chapter Śāntideva expresses his devotion to that ideal and honors those who are advanced on the path towards to. This raises two questions: The Cessation of Suffering and Buddhist Axiology – Daniel Breyer (.pdf) But what makes awakening good? MN 3: Heirs in the Teaching (.pdf) How (and why) did the Buddha suggest that we pay him homage? Chapter 2: Confession Accepting our faults is a critical starting point for ethical development, and a practice that the Buddha talked much about: AN 8.14: Wild Colts (.pdf) How do you react when someone criticizes you? Can you recognize yourself or someone you know in each of these eight ways? MN 15: Measuring Up (.pdf) Venerable Mahā Moggallāna lists 16 qualities that make someone easy to admonish. SN 42.8: A Horn Blower (.pdf) The Buddha points out that even a killer only spends a small amount of their time actually killing, pointing out how hard it is to know ourselves. Chapter 3: Taking Hold of Bodhicitta Ud 5.1: About the King (.pdf) A Queen gives her King a shockingly honest answer, prompting the Buddha to teach “The Golden Rule” MN 46: The Greater Discourse on Ways of Undertaking Things (.pdf) A rather remarkable sutta, in which the Buddha admits that it’s often painful to strictly follow the precepts. Given that following the precepts sometimes leads to pain, why does the Buddha still recommend them? Dāna: The Practice of Giving – Susan E. Jootla, Lily de Silva, Maurice Walshe, Nina van Gorkom, and Ācariya Dhammapāla (.pdf) (.epub) The corner stone of Buddhist morality is generosity, for all other virtues start in its renunciation and care for others. But clearly there are better and worse ways to give, as rich people often demonstrate. What factors make giving better or worse? Chapter 4: Carefulness SN 47.19: The Acrobat Simile How does the Buddha advise that we care for others? SN 9.14: The Scent Thief (.pdf) The standard for “refraining from taking that which was not given” can be extremely high! From the perspective of the Buddhist path, what is so blameworthy about “stopping to smell the roses?” MN 41: The Brahmins of Sālā (.pdf) People often acuse Theravada Buddhism of focusing only on strict, negative ethics, but I find it helpful to know what not to do. Ten Ways to Make Merit – Ajahn Suchart (.pdf) But this reputation isn’t wholely deserved, as Ajahn Suchart points out here that there are a number of good things Theravada Buddhism encourages. Chapter 5: Vigilant Introspection Two Questions on Ethics – Ajahn Jayasaro (.m4a) Ajahn Jayasaro answers two common questions on the five precepts, including whether it breaks the precepts to have a glass of wine for your health. MN 5: Unblemished (.pdf) As we improve our conduct and remove our blemishes, humility might seem to dictate that we don’t acknowledge our increasing virtue. What harm can come from refusing to accurately assess our purity? MN 61: Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.mp3) (.text) (.pdf) In one of the most famous similes of the canon, the Buddha encourages his son to constantly watch his own behavior to see what it reveals about his heart. Chapter 6: Patience MA 25: Discourse on the Five Ways of Putting an End to Anger (.pdf) The Buddha never condoned anger, but what can we do if anger does arise? You’re Not a Bad Person: How Facing Privilege Can Be Liberating – Miki Kashtan (.pdf) We can improve ourselves and the world without anger or guilt. Chapter 7: Diligence The Simile of the Cloth and The Discourse on Effacement: Two Discourses of the Buddha – Ven. Nyanaponika Thera (.pdf) (.epub) Two of the most important suttas on Buddhist Ethics in the whole canon, translated with helpful notes. Ten Unwholesome Actions – Ajahn Suchart (.pdf) Whenever we lose our diligence, it show us where we lack wisdom. Where we have wisdom, we will have ease and prosperity. Chapter 8: Meditative Concentration Reflections on the Eight Precepts – Ajahn Jayasaro (.mp3) Why is Zen so minimalistic? Why take on the practice of celibacy or reduced eating? AN 10.54: Serenity (.pdf) What kinds of people are better not associated with? What kinds of places are better left behind? Nourishing the Roots: Essays on Buddhist Ethics – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) (.epub) And what does all this have to do with enlightenment anyway? Chapter 9: Wisdom MN 39: Mahā Assapura Sutta (The Greater Discourse at Assapura) (.pdf) What qualities distinguish the wise? The Exposition of Non-Conflict: MN 139 – Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli Thera (.pdf) (.epub) What is the highest external virtue? How can we avoid conflict in this world? Chapter 10: Conclusion What did you think going through The Way of the Bodhisattva a second time? Was anything new? How does it compare to the philosophy of the Pali Suttas? Did you notice any significant differences? At this point you should now have a firm grasp of Buddhist Ethics. For our “Midterm Exam”, write an essay comparing Buddhist Ethics to the popular ethics of your own culture. What do they agree on? Where do they diverge? Part 3: Engaging the World Now that we’ve finished Parts 1 and 2, we’ve covered the core of Buddhist Ethics and can revisit Philip Levine: What Work Is – Philip Levine Rereading the poem now, has your understanding changed at all since we started the course? How would you now explain what work is? You Can Have It – Philip Levine I give you back 1948. A poem about what time can do to a person. In Part 3 we return to Peter Harvey’s Introduction and, chapter by chapter, engage in a number of topical, ethical debates, starting with the Mahayana’s twist on Buddhist ethics already alluded to earlier in our comparison of the Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra to the Pāli Canon. As we go through this part of the course, please keep in mind the radical openness of our second Philip Levine poem, “You can have it.” How can we use our heart to check our intellect and our culture’s typical way of doing things? Chapter 3: Mahayana Adaptions Nine Considerations and Criteria For Benefiting Beings – Patrul Rinpoche (.pdf) An introduction to Mahayana Ethics from within the tradition, and an excellent set of caveats to keep in mind as we ethically navigate our own lives. Can Killing a Living Being Ever Be an Act of Compassion: The Act of Killing in the Abhidhamma and Pali Commentaries – Rupert Gethin (.pdf) A Theravada response to the Mahayana assertion of the existence of compassionate killing. The Trolley Car Dilemma: The Early Buddhist Answer and Resulting Insights – Ven Pandita (.pdf) Ven Pandita tackles the famous “Trolly Problem” from the perspective of Theravada Ethics, and illuminates a way in which Theravada and Mahayana ethics might agree more than you think. Chapter 4: Natural World The Green Pill – Melanie Joy An interview about carnism and the importance of mindfulness in living green and ethically. A Task for Mindfulness: Facing Climate Change – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) Mindfulness practices may be essential for facing climate change. Climate Change, Ethics, and the Field of Greed – Victor von der Heyde (.pdf) Especially as Buddhists can use their practice to set a good example for others. Chapter 5: Economics SN 17.5: A Dung Beetle (.pdf) In which the Buddha compares attachment to wealth to a dung beetle proud of her dung. Buddhist Approach to Economics – Ajahn Jayasaro (.mp3) A Buddhist monk who rejects money has a lot to say about economics, perhaps because of the objectivity that distance affords. MN 96: The Esukārī Sutta (.pdf) In which the Buddha thoroughly rejects the ancient Indian caste system. Iyothee Tass: Hero of Tamil Buddhism – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) The Tamil reformer who turned to Buddhism as a refuge from the current Indian caste system. The Global Refugee Crisis and the Gift of Fearlessness – Christina A. Kilby (.pdf) There is a profound connection between internal states of delusion and macroeconomic problems. Chapter 6: War and Peace War and Peace – Bhikkhu Bodhi and Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) An argument between two highly respected Theravada monks on the subject of whether war can ever be justified, Bhikkhu Bodhi wonders out loud, “War: what is it good for?” and Thanissaro Bhikkhu responds with, “Absolutely nothing!” Toward an Integral Critical Approach to Thinking, Talking, Writing, and Teaching About Race – Rhonda V. Magee (.pdf) An African American law professor gives a master class in nonviolent communication. Note: Sadly, Harvey’s Introduction doesn’t include a chapter explicitly on racism — a notorious blind spot for Buddhists both East and West which the Buddha himself pulled no punches in denouncing. Chapter 7: Suicide Suicide – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) An early Buddhist perspective on suicide. Euthanasia – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) A Theravada answer to the question of euthanasia. Do you agree with their answers? What do you think makes the subject so uncomfortable? Chapter 8: Abortion Speaking of uncomfortable! When Does Human Life Begin? – Ajahn Brahm (.pdf) A Theravada monk gives an important clarification on the early Buddhist perspective on abortion and IVF, which later (conservative) texts have muddled in their quest for clear, crisp lines. Chapter 9: Sexual Equality Men Explain Things to Me – Rebecca Solnit (.pdf) Not Buddhist per se, but a contemporary classic, this essay shows exactly what casual sexism feels like. Thig 14.1: Subha and the Libertine (.pdf) Bhikkhuni Subha comes up with an extraordinary (if not recommended!) way of handling more serious sexual harassment, showing that women have long had to deal with the same problems. A Garland For the Bhikkhunis of Perth – Jacqueline Kramer (.pdf) But that doesn’t mean that things can’t or don’t get better. This letter celebrates one such step towards gender equality taken in recent years. Chapter 10: Sexuality Out of the Ordinary – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) The story of a pioneering, transgender Buddhist, and a word on how Buddhism’s attitude towards transgenderism differs from that of the monotheistic religions. Buddhism and Sex – Maurice Walshe (.pdf) (.epub) A refreshingly humble and non-dogmatic essay on everyone’s favorite topic, embodying the spirit of generous orthodoxy. A Gay Tragedy – Bhante Shravasti Dhammika (.pdf) A reminder that what we say matters. Conclusion Ajahn Brahm concludes by reminding us that between all the ethical debates and traditions and forms, there is a common core of good sense which we can rely on: Origins of Buddhism – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) Ajahn Brahm returns to the origins of Buddhism to help us understand the intentions and practice of “original” Buddhism.",

        "content": "What is Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts? The Imagery in the Early Buddhist Texts is the way that the Buddha used suggestive language to convey his teachings. All language is (of course) in some way referential: words are merely pointers. But more so than many works of literature, the Early Buddhist Texts are so tightly interwoven that it’s almost cliche to call the dhamma “a net.” As we pick up any of the words, images, or strands of the teachings, its associations, connections and references seem inevitably to take the whole of the Canon with it! Because of this, coming to understand the words and images of the Canon can be both incredibly challenging and rewarding: a powerful “Dharma Gate” that has inspired (and awakened!) a hundred generations of Buddhists — from the first “turning of the wheel” up to the present day. Prerequisites This course assumes some prior familiarity with the Early Buddhist Texts. Textbook This course will center around Bhikkhu Anālayo’s two “Excursions into the Thought World of the Pāli Discourses”: From Craving to Liberation: Excursions into the Thought-world of the Pāli Discourses Volume 1 – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) From Grasping to Emptiness: Excursions into the Thought-world of the Pāli Discourses Volume 2 – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) These two books each give a systematic treatment to a dozen important terms from the Pāli Canon, analyzing their nuances and the various ways each term is used. Similes of the Buddha – Hellmuth Hecker (.pdf) A thorough introduction to the similes of the early Canon, Hecker retells 85 similes and then gives a commentary on each. As we read through the Excursions we will also weave in the similes from this anthology to illustrate and “flesh out” the terms with images from the Canon. Please note that the Sutta references given throughout Bhikkhu Anālayo’s two books are to the volumes and page numbers of the PTS edition of the Pāli Canon, not to sutta numbers as you may be familiar with. Thankfully there is a converter tool online you can use to turn the PTS references into “normal” sutta numbers (and even links to SuttaCentral). Note also that while a few suttas are “assigned reading” below, please don’t let that limit you! Feel free to explore Anālayo and Hecker’s many sutta references, even if they aren’t on the assigned reading list!",

Can you come up with any similes that might speak to a more modern audience? As you leave this course and continue your life, I hope that you will take some of the wisdom and attentiveness of this course with you and stay on the lookout for situations and images that remind you of the Buddha’s wisdom.

        "content": "Before we dive into the three main books, let’s first set the stage a bit by going back in time. Pyrotechnic Imagery The fire of passion being “extinguished” gives us the term “Nibbāna (nirvāna)” and the fire of samādhi (meditation) is an enduring image in both text and art. As we start to move back in time to the Buddha’s India, let us gaze a little closer into the flames: The Buddha’s Fire Miracles – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) Bhikkhu Analayo demonstrates the interdependence of text and early art by showing how fire motifs in early Buddhist art found their way back into the texts as miracles. It shows another way in which a visual understanding of the EBTs is critical, and hints at how the symbols we’re so familiar with (like those above) became so widespread. Mythology as Meditation: From the Mahāsudassana Sutta to the Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra – Rupert Gethin (.pdf) (.pdf) We go a bit further back in time with Rupert Gethin to explore a particular myth in the DN and how it might have been read as a story of meditation. Playing With Fire: Pratityasamutpada From the Perspective of Vedic Thought – Joanna Jurewicz (.pdf) Many of the Buddha’s contemporaries were fire worshipers and the vedas put fire front and center in their mythology. This paper explores how the Buddha played with the Vedic fire imagery to create his own explanation of origination, bringing us right back to the Buddha’s own intentions. See Also: The Mind Like Fire Unbound – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) (.epub) Ajahn Geoff explores the symbolism of extinguishment in the context of ancient Indian physics to give us another take on this central image of Buddhist soteriology in this extra credit reading. While a more thorough understanding of India at the time of the Buddha will have to wait for another time, I hope the above gives some sense of the thought world of ancient India that we peer back into as we…",

Congratulations! You’ve now finished the entire book! Reflection It’s interesting to me that Bhikkhu Anālayo placed “emptiness” last. It seems to borrow from later Mahayana thoughts on the “two truths” and “perfection of wisdom,” since emptiness in the EBTs seems more closely related to vipassana than vimutti. What do you think? Is emptiness the end of the path, or merely instrumental? How does understanding the EBTs as rhetoric help you to answer this question?",

        "content": "Part 1: From Craving to Liberation With that background we’re now ready to dive into the meat of the course: the textbooks themselves. If you haven’t already, now is a good time to read the Introduction to Hecker as well as Analayo’s From Craving as they set up the works we’ll be looking at for the remainder of the class. We will follow Bhikkhu Analayo’s Excursions in order, but alongside reading each chapter, read a few suttas and some essays from Hecker. As you go through the course, it might be a good idea to keep a notebook of the suttas that speak to you: a personal “medicine cabinet” of the Buddha’s words that you can return to for inspiration and guidance whenever you need it. It’s a good idea (if it helps you) to take notes on your own reflections, connections and ideas as you learn, but if you do I encourage you to keep those notes separate from your “anthology.” Taṇhā — Craving Chapter one of From Craving to Liberation is about, well, craving. Bhikkhu Analayo’s essay explores this term in depth. It can be read either before the suttas (as a primer) or after them (as an explainer). Suttas SN 27.8: Craving What are the different types of craving? MN 9.17: The Four Noble Truths In defining Right View, the Four Noble Truths and “Craving” are central. AN 6.61: In the Middle Who is the “seamstress” of Saṃsāra? Snp 4.1: Objects, Desires, Pleasures A poem on our addiction to things of the world. Similes Next, read the introduction to Part 2 (not part 1) of Hecker, along with similes 16 (The Wheel of Existence) and 57 (Sensual Desire). Reflections Having read the above, I noticed that craving figures prominantly in Buddhism’s central images: the wheel, the boat, the arrow… I also noticed that these images all have the feeling of laborious, man-made objects. I guess that the Buddha is encouraging us to look at craving and to see it as something tedious and artificial, which we have both the power and desire to stop. What did you notice?",

        "content": "What is the Majjhima Nikāya? The Majjhima Nikāya (or Middle Length Discourses) are a canonical collection of stories about early Buddhism preserved in the Pāli Canon of the Theravada tradition. These stories are neither as condensed as the poetry collections or Connected Discourses (which were stripped of much of their narrative context by the redactors) nor are they as elaborate as the (more mythological) Lengthy Discourses. Traditionally, the Majjhima Nikāya (or MN for short) would have been a primary subject of study for new monks. The first ten discourses in particular would have been memorized (!) and analyzed in depth to form the foundation for the novice’s continued study and practice. As such, the MN strikes a nice balance between assuming intelligence and spiritual earnestness on the part of the reader (unlike, for example, the more family-friendly Jataka tales) without assuming too much in the way of prior doctrinal knowledge (unlike, for example, the more pithy Connected Discourses). As Western-educated rationalists, The Middle Length Discourses are also an excellent place for us to lay our foundation, as their “middle length” provides us with enough narrative framing to imagine the Buddha in his cultural and historical context, without being so mythologically grandiose as to be unpalatable to modern ears. Finally, in addition to striking such delicate balances, the Majjhima Nikāya also contains many individual suttas of such extraordinary depth and profound beauty as to be worth reading and rereading, pondering and savoring again and again, strictly on their own literary merits, let alone for the critical part they serve on the path to Awakening. Prerequisites This course requires prior familiarity with Buddhism and its purpose. Time Requirement This course is quite long if you hope to complete it. But don’t worry: each of the modules (not to mention each sutta) is a fairly self-contained unit and can be studied independently based on your interests. Feel free to pick and choose as you like! For those looking to take the entire course, I recommend setting aside a few hours per week to study the Majjhima Nikaya — perhaps Wednesdays, Sundays, or Uposatha Days — whatever works for you. Make these days a special “holy” day, dedicated to your practice and study. Read one sutta, listen to the lecture(s) on it and reflect. Take your time. Meditate on it. Let this weekly ritual become part of your life. If you keep it up, in a few years you may even be sad to know that you’ve finished the course! Course Outline In this course, we study the Early Buddhist Texts by reading the Majjhima Nikaya. I recommend first reading Ajahn Sujato’s Guide to the Majjhima Nikaya if you haven’t already, to orient yourself, and listen to the introductory lecture by Bhikkhu Bodhi to get a sense of what to expect from this course. Textbook The main text for this course is The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha by Bhikkhu Ñānamoli and Bhikkhu Bodhi published by Wisdom Publications, some of which has been released for free: Selections from the Majjhima Nikāya – Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) (.epub) A Creative Commons licensed selection of suttas from Wisdom’s celebrated translation, representing about a third of the full book. It’s still highly recommended that you get the monograph though, as many important suttas are missing from this anthology and the endnotes and introductions in the original are quite helpful. For the suttas not included in the free anthology above, or to get an alternative translation, please also refer to the complete, free translation by Bhante Sujato: The Middle Discourses – Bhante Sujato (.pdf) (.epub) All of which can be accessed online at SuttaCentral.net. Optional: About the Texts Advanced students, interested in engaging with the history and Northern versions of the texts, may want to read Bhante Analayo’s comparitive studies after each sutta: A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.PDFs) A thorough examination of each discourse in the Majjhima-nikāya in the light of its parallels. In this thousand-page tome, Bhikkhu Analayo goes systematically through the MN, one sutta at a time, and explains how the Pāli text differs (or not) from its parallels preserved in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan. Perhaps surprisingly, they don’t differ all that much, though in some places the differences do shed light on the original teaching and shows what kinds of changes occurred to the texts during the process of transmission. The book begins and ends with Bhikkhu Analayo’s reflections on the EBTs and the process of oral transmission, and while the book could certainly be read cover-to-cover, the primary way to use this book is as a reference work alongside the Majjhima Nikaya. You can also download the book for free at the University of Hamburg website: Volume 1 and Volume 2 If you’re anything like me, you’ll be amazed at how little the recensions differ, despite the thousands of miles and many hundreds of years between them. This striking congruence gives us solid confidence that the Majjhima Nikaya was well preserved. Lectures Bhikkhu Bodhi will be your lecturer for this course. His lectures have been arranged thematically into nine parts and do not go sequentially through the collection— until parts 10 and “11” (on YouTube), which do go back and cover all the skipped suttas. Instructions Look ahead to the next lecture to see which sutta comes next (the first lecture, for example, is called “M0001 MN-026 - Ariyapariyesana Sutta - The noble search.mp3” so you know to read the 26th discourse first). Then follow these steps: Read (or listen to!) the sutta before class. Listen to the lecture(s) associated with that sutta. Optionally, look up the sutta in Bhikkhu Analayo’s Comparative Study to see how the Chinese (and other) parallels might enrich (or simplify!) our understanding of the Pāli text. Cross that sutta off your checklist Repeat the above for the next sutta in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lecture series. In this way, you’ll start to develop the ability to read and understand the suttas independently. You may eventually find yourself not needing to rely so much on Bhikkhu Bodhi’s commentary, and understanding the suttas on your own. If so, congratulations! You’re reading the suttas! Feel free to drop the lectures if they cease being useful. That means you’ve “graduated” Referring Back As you deepen your study of Buddhism, you may (nay, should!) find yourself referring back to the Majjhima Nikaya often. This “course” can also be used in that way: as a reference to be touched as needed. The lecture series (and Bhante Analayo’s comparative study) contains every sutta, so whichever you’re interested in learning more about, you’ll find above. Either (as a course or as a reference) is an appropriate use of this material. Feel free to jump in directly to the section of Bhikkhu Bodhi’s lectures relevant to your current interests, or refer to Bhante Analayo’s notes to see how a curious Pāli passage compares to its parallels. There are many uses for this material and I encourage you to make it your own! In case it’s useful for such referencing, here’s an index of the suttas by their Pāli name: Pāli Sutta Names in the Majjhima Nikāya (.pdf) Many suttas in the MN are often referred to by their Pali name. If you have trouble finding them, here is an index from Pāli names to their traditional placement within the Majjhima Nikaya (usually noted as “MN #”, e.g. “MN 3” for the third sutta) And, again, I recommend keeping a checklist (or diary) of which suttas you’ve read, so you know where to come back to later.

        "content": "What is Nibbāna? Nibbāna (literally: “extinguishing” or “quenching”) is the unconditional happiness and clarity of mind which is the goal of Buddhist practice. Rather than seeing suffering as the inevitable flip side of happiness, Buddhism sees suffering as an affliction caused by a specific condition within the heart, namely wanting the world to be other than the way that it is. From this angle, there are two ways to achieve happiness: forcing the world to conform to our wishes or accepting things as they are. These two methods for achieving happiness are, of course, unequal. Getting what we want is a fleeting happiness while letting go of our neediness leads to a lasting contentment. If we are fine however things turn out, then we will always be happy. Even when death comes for us, we can remain cool and unperturbed — leaving no “unfinished business.” The mental “seeds” of “I want…” or “I meant to…” which normally lead us on are, in fact, only the seeds of suffering. By attending closely and continuously to the workings of our own mind, we can eventually see this directly: that grasping is painful. As this realization dawns, we naturally let go. The radiance of insight sterilizes the seeds of discontent. This “dhamma eye of wisdom” opens when we see for ourselves that absolutely everything is impermanent and therefore unsatisfying. Seeing this danger in clinging to the things of the world, the practitioner begins the process of letting go. When she’s let go of everything, to her immense surprise, she experiences nibbāna: freedom from conditioned phenomena. Prerequisites This course assumes prior knowledge about Buddhist practice. Familiarity with the early texts and Buddhist philosophy is recommended but not required. Textbooks A perilous flood has arisen For those oppressed by old age and death Let me declare an island to you ~ Snp 5.10 This free anthology will be our textbook for the class: The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha’s Teachings on Nibbāna – Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro (.pdf) (.epub) A compendium of ‘essence’ teachings on nibbāna, as they appear in the Pāli Canon and in contemporary traditions. This secondary monograph will be threaded through the course to help contextualize the historical developments: Metaphor and Literalism in Buddhism: The Doctrinal History of Nirvana – Soonil Hwang (.pdf) Gives a thorough summary of how nibbāna evolved as a concept in ancient India as a reaction to the ideas of rival sects. Course Outline The course will simply go sequentially through The Island. As you read each chapter, please refer back here for some supplemental readings and a few talks. Part 1: Seeds In part one of our course, we do a deep analysis of the word “nibbāna” and try to understand its connotations and use. This section plants the “seeds” for our analysis of the philosophy, practice and fruits in the later sections of the course. What is Nibbāna? The Introduction and Chapter 1 of Metaphor and Literalism (hereafter, “ML”) Will give an introduction to this text and to the term “nibbāna” Nibbāna – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) A standard definition and straightforward typology of Nibbāna. Sometimes we will talk about nibbāna as a philosophical entity and at other times as a psychological state, or even as a meditation experience. This essay gives a good outline of these different aspects. Useful to keep in mind throughout the course, that “Nibbāna” can refer to a few different things! Snp 5.10: The Questions of Kappa – Ajahn Sucitto (.mp3) The beautiful sutta from which our textbook (The Island) gets its name. SN 43: Connected Discourses on the Unconditioned – Joseph Goldstein (.mp3) “The Island” is, however, not the only synonym for the ultimate given in the early texts. This chapter from the Saṃyutta Nikāya lists 43 others to give us a better idea of its character. Synonyms for Nibbāna According to Prajñavarman, Vasubandhu and Asaṅga – Peter Skilling (.pdf) (.pdf) While sadly these forty synonyms were lost in the Chinese Tradition, Skilling shows that SN 43 (above) was preserved in Tibet. Fire, Heat, and Coolness Chapter two of The Island gives us the basic metaphorical image behind the term “Nibbāna”. ML: Chapter 2 - The Two Nirvana Theory A discussion of the imagery of fuel and fire, and an analysis of the important “Two Nirvana Theory” curiously left out of The Island. What is “The Two Nirvana Theory”? Read this chapter to find out! And if you’re still thinking that Nirvana is some heaven realm somewhere… Nibbāna and the Fire Simile – Bhikkhu Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda (.pdf) Bhante Ñāṇananda disabuses us of that notion, by reminding us that “Nirvana” simply means relinguishing: letting go of fuel. The Mind Like Fire Unbound – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) (.epub) And Ajahn Geoff further explores ancient Indian phsysics to come up with a striking, new (old) take on this central metaphor. A long booklet, but well worth the read. Part 2: Terrain This is the main section of the course. We’ll cover the rest of Metaphor and Literalism and the core philosophical dimentions of nibbāna. This, That, and Other Things ML: Chapter 3 - Developments of the Two Nirvana Theory The Abhidharma Tradition took Nirvana from a metaphor and turned it into a physical reality (“dhatu”). This leads to some problems, particularly how this “ultimate reality” differs from the “ultimates” postulated by other religions. Vedānta and Buddhism – Helmuth von Glasenapp (.pdf) (.epub) This booklet helps to answer that very question, by explaining the middle way and contrasting it to the influential Vedāntic theology. I personally find that The Island occasionally leans on the side of eternalism (or at least doesn’t argue against it to my satisfaction), so the above chapter and booklet will be especially good to read and keep in mind. All That is Conditioned We will return to Metaphor and Literalism in a few chapters, but first let us talk for a while about nibbāna’s opposites: conditioned reality and suffering (dukkha). AN 8.5: World (1) (.pdf) How does an arahant relate to the world? To an enlightened being, even sensual pleasures are seen as painful for how fleeting they are indeed! To Be or Not to Be Snp 5.4: The Questions of Mettagū – Ajahn Sucitto (.mp3) What is the difference between an Ordinary and an Enlightened being? Anattā and Nibbāna: Egolessness and Deliverance – Ven. Nyanaponika Thera (.pdf) (.epub) How is “extinguishing” the Middle Way? How is it not nihilism? How is “extinguishing” different from “annihilation”? Fear of Freedom – Bhante Sujato How is it that we both long for and fear freedom? Not Made of That Advice on Abandoning the Eight Worldly Concerns – Nyala Pema Dündul (.pdf) What is “non-duality” and, more importantly, how does one practice it? Attending to the Deathless Snp 5.15: Posāla’s Question Is “the deathless” the same as “nothingness”? What knowledge eradicates ignorance? Enlightenment – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.pdf) An excellent, clear summary of the path and its fruit, connecting the dots between mindfulness meditation and the attaining of nibbāna. Unsupported and Unsupportive Consciousness What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna – Ajahn Brahmali (.pdf) It is very important (and very difficult!) to understand that the “experience” of nibbāna is no experience at all! Ajahn Brahmali here argues the other side of the “debate” from The Island, explaining how “anidassana viññāṇa” should be understood, not as a hidden, pure, or non-dual consciousness, but as something else entirely. Viññāṇa anidassana: The State of Boundless Consciousness – Bhikkhu Sunyo (.pdf) And in this brilliant essay, Bhante Sunyo proposes a most elegant solution to the problem in this verse. The Unconditioned and Nonlocality Nibbāna and Abhidhamma – L. S. Cousins (.pdf) (.pdf) If experiences, not metaphysical “elements,” were the point of Early Buddhism, how did nibbāna develop into the “unconditioned element”? Metaphor and Literalism: Chapter 4 - Nibbāna in the Theravada Buddhist Tradition We return to ML and the analogy of fire in order to better understand the Theravada developments to the doctrines of nibbāna and anatta. The Unapprehendability of the Enlightened Snp 5.6: The Questions of Upasīva – Ajahn Sucitto (.mp3) The Buddha gives pithy answers to Upasīva about the path to liberation and the status of anāgāmīs and arahants. MN 71: Tevijja Vacchagotta Sutta (.pdf) Even in the Buddha’s day (all the more so later) people tried to attribute omniscience to the Buddha: a claim he rejected. In this sutta, the Buddha explains that, rather than omniscience, it’s right view and renunciation that make nibbāna “unapprehendable” by ordinary people. ML Chapter 5 - The Northern Schools If you are interested in the Northern schools of Indian Buddhism (which came to be part of the Mahayana), you may want to read Chapter 5 at this point. If you’re uninterested in the Mahayana, however, you will probably want to skip this chapter of Metaphor and Literalism ‘Reappears’ Does Not Apply AN 4.195: Vappa (.pdf) “everything becomes cool when nothing is relished” In This Pure Awareness – Khenpo Shenga (.pdf) On what it feels like to transcend the categories On Translating ‘Buddha’ – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) Bhikkhu Bodhi discusses the nature of Buddhist enlightenment in order to defend using the English term “enlightenment” to describe it at all. Key to his argument is that complete liberation is described as the arising of true knowledge. Once ignorance is destroyed, it will never appear again. Metaphor and Literalism: Conclusion and Translations The Conclusion is worth a read to tie together our study of Nirvana’s history. Those interested in the primary sources may also wish to read the translations in Part Two. Even a quick skim may be helpful to get a general impression of the genre, but don’t worry: this part won’t be on the final exam! Epilogue: Knowing, Emptiness and the Radiant Mind We wrap up this, the main, section of our course, with a brief word on the “Radiant Mind” and related perennial topics: The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) Bhikkhu Analayo gives a careful, textual study of the supposedly “luminous” nature of the mind in early Buddhism. Is such a view supported by the early texts or is this a later development? Channa’s Suicide in the Saṃyukta-āgama – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) The curious case of an arahant committing suicide. Can someone who has attained the goal decide to kill themselves? Part 3: Cultivation The next two parts of the course shift from philosophical to more practical considerations: How is enlightenment achieved? The Gradual Path The Nature of the Eight-factored Ariya, Lokuttara Magga in the Suttas – Peter Harvey (.pdf) What is the relationship between the mundane and supermundane paths? How did these concepts develop? Sudden Penetration MN 44: Cūḷavedalla Sutta (The Shorter Series of Questions and Answers) This deep sutta on the details of the meditative “experience” of nibbāna takes place as a discussion between the Bhikkhuni Dhammadinnā and her student, the layman Visākha. How is “the unconditioned” conditioned? MN 44: Culavedalla Sutta Study – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) Ajahn Brahm celebrates their Bhikkhuni ordination with a talk on this sutta. The Path and Goal The Arahat – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.mp3) An introduction to the final goal of Buddhist Practice. Part 4: Fuition We finally come to the last, but perhaps most important, part of our course: the experience of enlightenment itself. We will break it down into two lessons: on the first breakthrough and the final release. Sotāpanna Sotāpanna (or a Stream Winner) is someone who has attained the first stage of awakening. They have eliminated doubt and are firmly on the path to final deliverance. We will conceptualize this “turning point” in the spiritual career first with this work on the stages of insight that lead up to Stream Entry: The Progress of Insight – Mahāsi Sayadaw (.pdf) What does it feel like as we transition from ordinary to super-mundane practice? The Stages of Awakening – Ayya Anandabodhi (.mp3) A short talk on balancing faith and knowledge against expectations. “Ah, What Bliss!” — Conclusion The citta of the Arahant is Empty – Luangta Maha Boowa (.pdf) Ajahn Maha Boowa describes what it’s like to be an arahant in this short talk delivered near the end of his life. The Arahant – John D. Ireland (.pdf) (.pdf) A short, ecstatic poem from the SN. After Nibbana – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) “What’s next?” What happens after enlightenment? With those final words of inspiration, our course is now finished. The rest is up to us.",

        "content": "What is Buddhist Philosophy? Buddhist Philosophy (right view, thought, understanding, and wisdom) is both the beginning and the end of the Buddhist Path. Without confidence in the power of action and the dangers of greed, hatred and delusion, one can only practice the path half-heartedly at best. And yet the overcoming of ignorance is itself the goal of the path. Buddhist Philosophy thus has a bootstrapping problem: how can deluded beings ever climb out of darkness? The Buddha starts with what we can know directly: suffering. People can mislead you about many things, but when you’re suffering nobody can tell you that you’re not. You can directly know this first truth yourself. This gives us the self-confidence that there are truths we can directly know and it builds our confidence in the Buddha who pointed this out. Faith leads to effort, effort leads to results, and so the whole path unfolds from the basic observation of pain. From this process we can make out a few points regarding Buddhist Philosophy. Most distinct is that it is phenomenological. Buddhist Philosophy is primarily concerned with our subjective experiences. Second, within this “event driven” rather than “object oriented” framework, we notice a distinct emphasis on cause and effect. The Buddhist universe is neither chaotic nor predetermined, but is rather conditioned by our choices. Lastly, Buddhist Philosophy is teleological. It has a goal, a purpose beyond merely describing reality. It points the way out of views, attachments, and prejudices and towards the direct understanding of reality itself. Buddhist Philosophy is thus the way of thinking which leads beyond thought. Prerequisites This course assumes some familiarity with the purpose of Buddhism. Prior comfort with the Early Buddhist Texts is not required, though may be helpful. Lectures This course rests on Bhikkhu Bodhi’s classic cassette tapes from 1981: The Buddha’s Teaching As It Is – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.mp3s) These lectures are a walkthrough of the orthodox Theravada doctrine. I recommend not listening to the lectures while doing something else, but instead giving them your full attention, pausing the recording as needed to digest and reflect. It may be helpful to set aside a 1.5–2 hour time slot for the lectures once per week, to give yourself a deadline to complete your “homework” and to ensure that you can listen to the lectures undistracted. But this is just a suggestion. You’re of course welcome to make your way through the material however you like. In addition to Bhikkhu Bodhi’s formal lectures, each week contains some additional, more casual, talks by other monks and nuns. Textbook In lieu of a textbook, this course will weave in the Selections from the Majjhima Nikaya on the Doctrine which Bhikkhu Bodhi recommended be required reading for studying Buddhist Philosophy. These suttas are linked to web translations, but feel free to read (or listen to) the suttas in whichever translation (and medium) you prefer. Please read the suttas and other readings on your own “before class” and spend some time reflecting on them, preferably for a day or two, before listening to the lecture. Don’t feel discouraged if you find the suttas difficult at first. I’m sure you’ll be a pro sutta-reader by the end of the class! You may want to keep a copy of the assigned suttas in front of you while listening to the lectures, so that you can refer back to them and take notes as inspiration strikes, keeping in mind that the recordings (unlike live lectures!) can easily be paused. In addition to the suttas, this course assigns four short books in weeks 2, 4, 7, 8 and 9: The Four Noble Truths, The Heart of Understanding, Inspiring Dhamma, Wisdom Develops Samadhi, and BuddhaDhamma for University Students respectively, so be advised to budget a little extra time for the homework these weeks. Note also that one of these books (The Heart of Understanding) is a commercial work which you’ll have to acquire on your own. Course Outline This course gives a traditional, 10-week introduction to Theravada Buddhist Philosophy. It does not cover comparative philosophy or the history of philosophy and it does not attempt to present the theory from a Western frame, nor even from a practical angle. Instead, this course opts for an approach modeled on the traditional Theravada commentaries. My own bias, however, is towards early Buddhism. So, while the Abhidhamma Tradition (at least as presented here) doesn’t stray too far from the Pāli Canon, there are a couple points throughout the course where differences will be noted. The class is structured into 10 “weeks.” Each week assigns some suttas and other readings for “homework” before the main lecture for that week. Each week ends with a breakout session I call the “sutta spotlight” in which we do a closer reading of a related sutta from the Majjhima Nikaya with a guest monastic, before advancing on to the homework for the following “week.” Introduction But before we get started, here is a brief introduction to Wisdom in Early Buddhism. Early Buddhist Wisdom – Bhante Sujato and Ajahn Brahmali (.zip) Bhante Sujato and Brahmali give us a guest lecture on wisdom to start our course. They introduce the main points we’ll analyze in depth, and also briefly explain why this course doesn’t follow the “conventional versus ultimate realities” dichotomy that many have used to explain Buddhist philosophy. Start here! Week 1: The Buddha and the Cosmos We start the course proper by talking about the founder and central figure of Buddhism and his important role in Buddhist Cosmology. Homework MN 26: Ariyapariyesanā Sutta (The Noble Search) (.pdf) The Buddha’s autobiography: He gives the bhikkhus a long account of his own quest for enlightenment from the time of his life in the palace up to the transmission of the Dhamma to his first five disciples. Don’t worry if this sutta is a bit difficult to read. We’ll cover the suttas enough throughout this course that you’ll get the hang of reading them soon enough. Cosmology and Meditation: From the Aggañña-Sutta to the Mahāyāna – Rupert Gethin (.pdf) Rupert Gethin gives us a way of reading Buddhist mythology as a guide to the terrain of meditation. On the Normative Function of Metatheoretical Endeavors – Zachary Stein (.pdf) Zachary Stein gives us an impassioned defense of asking big questions, and refers obliquely to our own postmodern “noble search” for philosophical grounding. Lecture BB-001_The_Buddha.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi introduces us to the cosmology of Buddhism and the wonderous appearance of a Buddha in the world. Sutta Spotlight MN 12: Māhasīhanāda Sutta (The Greater Discourse on the Lion’s Roar) The Buddha expounds the ten powers of a Tathāgata, his four kinds of intrepidity, and other superior qualities, which entitle him to “roar his lions roar in the assemblies.” MN 12: Māhasīhanāda Sutta Study – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) Ajahn Brahm teaches this sutta and gives a few stories from his time as a monk in Thailand in this wonderful and highly recommended talk. Don’t miss it! Essay Time Write a page or two on which qualities of the Buddha inspire you. How would you like to be more “Buddha-like?” How does Buddhist mythology support your aspiration? Week 2: The Four Noble Truths The very core of Buddhist Philosophy, this week we introduce the Buddha’s diagnosis of the spiritual disease. Because this is such an important doctrine, I have assigned slightly more homework this week than normal: an indulgence I hope you will forgive. Homework Right View and the Scheme of the Four Noble Truths: The Saṃyukta-āgama Parallel to the Sammādiṭṭhi-sutta and the Simile of the Four Skills of a Physician – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) Venerable Analayo shows how the Four Noble Truths are akin to a medical treatment plan: from diagnosis to cure. MN 141: Analysis of the Truths (.pdf) The Venerable Sariputta gives a detailed analysis of the Four Noble Truths. The Four Noble Truths – Ajahn Sumedho (.pdf) (.epub) The Venerable Sumedho gives a detailed analysis of the Four Noble Truths. MN 63: The Shorter Discourse to Mālunkyāputta (.pdf) A Bhikkhu threatens to leave the Order unless the Buddha answers his metaphysical questions. With the simile of a man struck by a poisoned arrow, the Buddha makes plain exactly what he does and does not teach in this sutta mentioned in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s talk below. Last week we learned about Buddhist cosmology, while this sutta eschews metaphysics! What gives?! How do you explain this contradiction? Lecture BB-002_Four_Noble_Truths.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a thorough treatment of suffering and introduces us to the five aggregates. Sutta Spotlight This week we’ve covered a lot of ground and hopefully have a firm framework off which to hang the rest of Buddhist Philosophy. We explored the Four Noble Truths and we thought about why the Buddha taught what he did and what he chose not to discuss. This “Sutta Spotlight” shows how that “hanging together” works with a vivid example from the Canon. But before reading this sutta, please take a moment to consider how you would explain the relationship between the Four Noble Truths, the Four Material Elements, the Five Aggregates and the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. How would you “fit” these teachings together? MN 28: The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint (.pdf) The venerable Sāriputta begins with a statement of the Four Noble Truths, which he then expounds by way of the four elements and the dependent origination of the five aggregates, showing how he fits all of the Buddha’s Teachings inside the framework of the Four Noble Truths. Greater Discourse on the Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo gives a brief talk on this profound sutta, revealing yet another (!) layer of its profundity. Week 3: The Nature of Reality (The First Noble Truth) The five aggregates of body and mind that we cling to as constituting a “self” and their nature to be impermanent, dissatisfying and uncontrollable, this week covers what the Buddha meant by “suffering.” Homework SN 35.85: Empty is the World (.pdf) The defining characteristic of the Buddhist conception of the world is “emptiness.” The question immediately arises: “The world is empty of what?” In this sutta, the Buddha gives us the answer: “It is empty of a self.” Notice in particular in this sutta the subtle redefinition of “the world” from our usual idea of it (objective material stuff) to something altogether more subjective and (ironically) personal. SN 22.59: Not Self (.pdf) Here we get the Buddha’s most straightforward explanation of what not-self means and its relevance to our project of overcoming suffering. Am I my five khaṅdhas? – Bhikkhu Cintita (.pdf) Through the simile of the chariot (similar to the “Ship of Theseus” from Western philosophy), Bhikkhu Cintita explains how the five aggregates are not-self. SN 5.10: Vajira (.pdf) The Bhikkhuni Vajira sums up the above in this beautiful poem. MN 109: The Greater Discourse on the Full-moon Night (.pdf) A bhikkhu questions the Buddha on the five aggregates, clinging, personality view, and the realization of non-self. This sutta will be implicitly analyzed in detail in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s third lecture below. I recommend reading it once before class and then having a copy in front of you while listening to the lecture. Anicca – Arvind Sharma (.pdf) (.pdf) This essay gives an introduction to the three characteristics and, by analysis, their function. Anything You Synthesize – The American Dollar Finally, we sum up the truth of the compounded and impermanent nature of all things, with this beautiful music video on impermanence. Lecture BB-003_Nature_of_Existence.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a detailed analysis of the five aggregates and three characteristics. Wisdom – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) This is all great theory, but how do we actually see it? Bhante Yuttadhammo gives a very brief introduction to the four foundations of mindfulness: the way to experience the five aggregates directly. Sutta Spotlight MN 140: The Exposition of the Elements Stopping at a potter’s workshop for a night, the Buddha meets a contemplative named Pukkusāti and gives him a profound and difficult discourse on the elements culminating in the four foundations of arahantship. MN 140 Sutta Class – Bhante Sujato Bhante Sujato walks us through this deep sutta, one of his (and, I must say, my) favorites, giving us a bit more info on the commentarial background story as well as the sutta’s parallel versions in the Mahayana Tradition. Pop Quiz! In your own words, how does seeing the Three Characteristics prepare the mind for Liberation? What does this say about the nature of Enlightenment? Week 4: Dependent Origination (The Second Noble Truth) The series of causes which lead to us constitute the disease for which our suffering is only the most obvious symptom. (Special Bonus!) Sutta Spotlight Dependent Origination is a notoriously difficult concept in Buddhism, so before this week gets started in earnest, I wanted to invite Bhikkhu Brahmali here to help us understand one discourse which explains the second noble truth in this, a very special, bonus edition of “sutta spotlight” MN 38: The Greater Craving-Destruction Discourse A bhikkhu named Sāti promulgates the pernicious view that consciousness transmigrates from life to life. The Buddha reprimands him with a lengthy discourse on dependent origination, showing how all phenomena of existence arise and cease through conditions. MN 38: Discussing the The Greater Discourse on the Destruction of Craving – Ajahn Brahmali (.mp3) Ajahn Brahmali covers this sutta in his ever-cheery style, explaining how rebirth is different from transmigration. Homework With that as an introduction, we’re perhaps ready to read this week’s homework and see how it fits together. Rāga (Lust or Passion) – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) A short article on rāga in the the Pāli Canon, one of the critical components causing suffering. Practical Dependent Origination – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.pdf) Bhante Yuttadhammo introduces Dependent Origination in his own way, trying to point towards its utility in practice. SA 301: The Discourse on the Middle Way (.pdf) This short sutra from the Chinese Canon explains another way of understanding “The Middle Way” Conditionality is explained as the middle way between the extremes of seeing things as existing and non-existing. When one understands that all things are impermanent and fading away, they cannot be seen as “existing” and when the relentless arising of phenomena is seen, it cannot be held that nothing exists either. The Heart of Understanding: Commentaries on the Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra – Thích Nhất Hạnh An incredibly popular and influential, modern (commercial) commentary on the (Mahayana) Heart Sutra presents a much beloved take on Huayan philosophy. Note especially the similarities or differences to the Theravada. How might these two perspectives on dependent origination illuminate each other? Purity of Heart – Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro (.pdf) Ajahn Geoff gives a brief rebuttal to Thich Nhat Hanh and tells a short, inspiring story about his own teacher. Before the lecture, think a bit about how studying conditionality and the three characteristics made you feel. Is Buddhist Philosophy pessimistic or optimistic or both or what? Lecture BB-004_Dependent_Origination.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi teaches the traditional analysis of Dependent Arising. See: When Does Human Life Begin? – Ajahn Brahm (.pdf) for a EBT rebuttal of the influential Abhidhammic doctrine that life begins exactly at the moment of conception. Sutta Spotlight MN 148: The Chachakka Sutta (Six by Six) This profound and penetrating discourse explains all the factors of sense experience (the middle factors of dependent origination) as being not-self. MN 148: Six by Six Discussion – Ajahn Nissarano (.mp3) Ajahn Nissarano gives a relaxed talk on this sutta and on our stubborn ignorance. Pop Quiz! How does the Theravada concept of dependent arising differ from the concept of interdependence in Thich Nhat Hanh’s writing? What function does each idea serve? Week 5: Rebirth and Kamma (The Second Noble Truth Continued…) Central to this wheel of origination which causes our suffering is our stubborn tendency to not die, but be reborn again and again into suffering. Homework Rebirth and the West – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) On belief in rebirth and the Buddhist path in historical perspective. MN 135: The Shorter Exposition of Action (.pdf) The Buddha explains how kamma accounts for the fortune and misfortune of beings. Teaching Karma – Robina Courtin (.m4a) (.m4a) Courtin describes how she introduces Karma to sceptical Westerners. Dependent Origination – Ajahn Brahm (.pdf) While dependent origination can be understood as describing both our moment-to-moment “rebirth” as well as our rebirth from lifetime to lifetime, many modern scholars sceptical of rebirth have tended to downplay the latter interpretation. Ajahn Brahm defends that interpretation by citing the Buddha’s own analysis of the twelve factors. AN 5.57: Themes for Frequent Recollection – Kamala Masters (.mp3) (.text) The five subjects for frequent recollection An Interview with Dr. Jim Tucker – Dr. Jim Tucker, Ajahn Brahmali, and Bhante Sujato Dr Jim Tucker is currently the world’s foremost scientist studying spontaneous past life recall. Lecture BB-005_Rebirth_and_Karma.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi gives a detailed explanation of rebirth and kamma according to the Theravada Abhidhamma. Rebirth and the In-between State in Early Buddhism – Bhante Sujato (.pdf) Ajahn Sujato corrects the rigid (read: erroneous) Theravada rejection of the bardo — the time between lives — giving justifications for it and some of his own thoughts on rebirth. Sutta Spotlight MN 42: The People of Verañja – Roland Kitchen (.mp3) (.pdf) In this sutta the Buddha explains to a group of Brahmin householders the courses of conduct leading to rebirth in lower realms and the courses leading to higher rebirth and deliverance. Essay Time Write a couple pages thinking honestly about the following questions: What about karma and rebirth feels right to you? Which parts do you currently have a harder time accepting? Setting aside Buddhist philosophy for a moment, how do you imagine this whole thing works? What do you really think you’ll experience after you die? Midterm In lieu of our usual sutta lecture (or an exam!), here’s some comedy instead to celebrate our course’s midterm: How to Discover What You Really Want – Ajahn Brahm (.m4a) Ajahn Brahm tells us all the secrets of life: from how to find a partner to getting what you really want. Week 6: Nibbāna (The Third Noble Truth) A completely pure mind is the end. In later philosophical traditions, this unique state of “spiritual health” came to be described in ontological terms, which we hope to clarify this week. Homework We open with some suttas from other collections than the MN, which Bhikkhu Bodhi will reference later in his lecture. SN 38.1: A Question About Nibbāna (.pdf) The basic definition of nibbāna. SN 22.86: Anuradha Sutta – Joseph Goldstein (.mp3) (.pdf) The Buddha explains the indescribability of the Arahants. The Sixfold Purity of an Arahant According to the Chabbisodhana-sutta and its Parallel – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) A thorough description of what makes someone fully enlightened. AN 3.47: Characteristics of the (Un) Conditioned (.pdf) A short, enigmatic description of conditioned phenomena (saṃsāra) and unconditioned phenomena (nibbāna). Ud 8.3: Nibbāna (3) (.pdf) A short exclamation on the existence of Nibbāna. What is the Eye? – Bhikkhu Cintita (.pdf) Bhikkhu Cintita explains what is meant by “the eye” in the Suttas, the radical phenomenology of it, and how this can help us understand (and realize) Nibbāna. Lecture BB-006_Nibbana.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi discusses the philosophical implications of the doctrine of Nibbāna drawn out in the Theravada Abhidhamma Sutta Spotlight MN 11: Cūḷasīhanāda Sutta (The Lesser Discourse on the Lion’s Roar) (.pdf) The Buddha declares that only in his Dispensation can the four grades of noble individuals be found, explaining how his teaching can be distinguished from other creeds through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self. MN 11: The Cūḷasīhanāda Sutta – Bhante Suddhāso (.mp3) Bhante Suddhaso explains this sutta and mentions how it relates to other philosophies. Pop Quiz! What are the two Nibbana elements (dhatu)? Week 7: The Eightfold Path (The Fourth Noble Truth) This week we introduce the path of practice which leads to the state of mental purity. There’s a number of beautiful and practical teachings this week, so I encourage you to keep track of what inspires you if you haven’t been keeping a notebook already. Homework Inspiring Dhamma – Ajahn Suchart (.pdf) Ajahn Suchart describes the path in his simple and direct way from the unique perspective of the four iddhipadas. SN 36.11: Alone (.pdf) One somewhat confusing point of Buddhist philosophy is that all three feelings (painful, neutral and pleasant) are included under “dukkha.” Thankfully for us, a monk at the time of the Buddha decided to ask him about that. MN 20: Vitakkasaṇṭhāna Sutta (The Relaxation of Thoughts) (.pdf) The Buddha outlines five methods for removing unwholesome thoughts, an important sutta Bhikkhu Bodhi will briefly talk about in his lecture. Lecture BB-007_Eightfold_Path.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi explains the middle way, from its mundane form to the supramundane version which delivers the yogi to nibbāna. Sutta Spotlight MN 75: To Māgandiya (.pdf) The Buddha meets the hedonist philosopher Māgandiya and points out to him the dangers in sensual pleasures, the benefits of renunciation, and the meaning of Nibbāna. Five Things for Attaining Right View – Bhante Yuttadhammo (.mp3) Bhante Yuttadhammo outlines the five preparatory factors we need to be open to the truth and to see the world from the right perspective, hopefully illuminating why Right View can be thought of as both the first and last step of the Noble Eightfold Path. Essay Time This course (Buddhist Philosophy) is focused on the first steps of the Noble Eightfold Path: Right View and Right Thought. What are some of the nuggets of wisdom this week that inspired you? Do those ideas relate at all to the Enlightened qualities which you wrote about in Week 1? What is the relationship between thinking and being? Week 8: Meditation Formal mind training is of course the hallmark of Buddhism. This course though is focused primarily on philosophy, so we’ll just look this week at how to think about meditation. Homework MN 43: The Great Classification The two suttas in this week take the form of discussions on various subtle points of Dhamma. This first sutta takes place between the venerable Mahā Koññhita and the venerable Sāriputta An Address to the Fo Guan Buddhist Monastic Retreat – Most Ven Hsin Bao (.pdf) (.wma) The Venerable Hsing Bao discusses the difficulties of practice, and how we slowly become more Buddha-like by seeing the world through the eyes of a Buddha. Wisdom Develops Samādhi: A Guide to the Practice of the Buddha’s Meditation Methods – Luangta Maha Boowa (.pdf) (.epub) The modern, Thai meditation master Luang Ta Maha Boowa explains the path and purpose of meditation. Lecture BB-008_Meditation.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi explains the theory surrounding meditation practice. Sutta Spotlight MN 117: The Great Forty (.pdf) The Buddha defines the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path and explains that meditative absorption is the culmination of all the previous factors of the path. MN 117: The Great Forty (Talk) – Ajahn Brahmali (.mp3) Ajahn Brahmali talks us through this Sutta, explaining in particular how mental purification follows on from ethical purification along with some thoughts on how this Sutta was influenced by the Theravada Abhidhamma, further highlighting the difference between “Early” and “Theravada” Buddhist Philosophy Pop Quiz! The Buddha’s description of meditation progress is somewhat fractal. Describe a couple patterns that recur at different levels or stages of meditation and name one or two possible (hint: pedagogical) reasons for this parallelism. Week 9: Social Teachings Zooming out from the individual training, Buddhist philosophy (contrary to popular belief) does have a lot of implications for larger social questions. This week we’ll focus on just a couple of those implications: the pedagogical environment implied by the training and the social harmony that results from it. Homework MN 95: The Caṅkī Sutta (.pdf) The Buddha instructs a young brahmin on the preservation of truth, the discovery of truth, and the final arrival at truth. Buddha-Dhamma For (University) Students – Buddhadāsa Bhikkhu (.pdf) 48 probing questions about Buddhist philosophy and life answered by a renowned Thai modernist. Buddhism: A Balancing Factor for Current World Developments – Ven Dhammavamso (.pdf) (.pdf) Persons of integrity provide the world with real progress. Lecture BB-009_Social_Teachings_of_the_Buddha.mp3 Bhikkhu Bodhi stresses that the Buddha’s teachings were not pessimistic or world-denying but rather teach us how to improve conditions in our present life. Sutta Spotlight MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhanda Sutta (The Greater Discourse on the Mass of Suffering) The Buddha explains the full understanding of dukkha — sensual pleasures, material form, and feelings — including a long section on the dangers in sensual pleasures. MN 13: Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta Study Class – Ajahn Brahm (.mp3) A sick Ajahn Brahm teaches us the meaning of suffering in this unstable, uncomfortable and out of control talk on the “Great Aggregates of Suffering” and their Three Characteristics. Essay Time Many people are already applying Buddhist ideas to improve e.g. addiction recovery and stress reduction programs. What is another social problem where you think Buddhist ideas might inform a better approach? Week 10: The Sangha The course began with the first refuge (the Buddha) and now, after explaining the Dhamma at length, can end with the third and final gem: the Sangha. Homework This is Peaceful, This is Excellent: Reflections on Monastic Life at Aranya Bodhi Hermitage – Marajina Samaneri (.pdf) Just because the robes and rules, the rights and rituals, of the Bhikkhus and the Bhikkhunis are indeed mere social conventions doesn’t mean that they are useless or unimportant. Through practice, these “mere” signs become invaluable for those who care about awakening. Lecture BB-010_The_Sangha.mp3 The Bhikkhu versus the Ariya Sangha and why it matters. Can the Theravada Bhikkhuni Order be Re-established? It Already Has – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.pdf) Since this talk was recorded, a method for reestablishing the Theravada Bhikkhuni order was successfully executed. These women’s ordinations have yet to be fully recognized by the governments of Sri Lanka, Burma or Thailand but Bhikkhu Bodhi himself has changed his mind on the issue, as he discusses in this short letter. Sutta Spotlight MN 137: The Exposition of the Sixfold Base (.pdf) The Buddha expounds the six internal and external sense bases and some related topics. MN 137: Analyzing the Six Sense Fields – Ayya Vayama (.mp3) Ayya Vayama Bhikkhuni explains how we progress on the path through renunciation and what progress means for our experience of painful feelings. One Final Writing Assignment Think of a friend who accidentally encouraged or inspired your own spiritual growth in some way. In lieu of a quiz or essay, this week I’d like you to write a letter thanking that person. You are, of course, not obliged to actually send it, though you may if you like. The gratitude itself is the assignment and its own reward. Conclusion MN 22: The Simile of the Water Snake (.pdf) A bhikkhu Ariṭṭha gives rise to a pernicious view that conduct prohibited by the Buddha is not really an obstruction due to a series of logical inferences. The Buddha reprimands him and, with a series of memorable similes, stresses the dangers in misapplying the Dhamma, reminding us all to philosophize responsibly. “That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” ~ AN 6.61",

        "content": "What are tranquility and insight? Tranquility and insight are the two proximate goals of Buddhist meditation. When you meditate on a single thing itself the mind will eventually become calm and collected. We call this samatha or tranquility meditation. If you meditate on the three characteristics—that things are impermanent, unsatisfying, and not our own—wisdom will arise. We call this vipassana or insight meditation. These two kinds of practice and result support each other. Insight requires tranquility because the mind must be stable and clear to see and to accept the truth. But tranquility requires wisdom which is what lets go of our thinking and worrying long enough to meditate and to stabilize the mind. So, as with mindfulness itself, we have to start where we are. We use whatever tranquility we have to remind ourselves what is real and we use whatever insight we have to let go of what is bothersome. As we let go more and more, we become calmer and calmer and as we become more and more calm we are able to see more and more clearly. In this way, tranquility and insight form the two wings which together lift us out of delusion. Prerequisites This course assumes a familiarity with meditation and the Pāli Canon. Prior knowledge of the Āgamas or Chinese is not required. Lectures Tranquility and Insight: Readings in the MĀ 3 – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.MP3s) (.PDFs) A lecture series on MĀ division 7 (sutras 72–86) revolving around the theme of balancing and developing tranquility with insight. The above lectures, along with their PDF notes, are the course. Textbook When Bhikkhu Anālayo first taught this class in 2013, there was not yet a published, English translation of the MA Sutras covered here. In 2020, however, he co-authored with Roderick Bucknell: The Madhyama Āgama: Volume 2 – Bhikkhu Anālayo and Roderick S. Bucknell (.pdf) A translation of MA Discourses 72–131. The first section of this book contains translations of the Madhyama Āgama Discourses covered in this course, so please feel free to reference these translations as you take the course. Pāli Parallels In addition to the main Madhyama Āgama sutras above, a number of discourses from the Pāli Canon will be referenced throughout the course, mostly as parallels to the MA discourse under investigation. I’ve collected them below for your convenience, in the order of their appearance in the course: AN 4.170: In Conjunction (.pdf) Ud 1.10: Bāhiya – Sarah Doering (.mp3) MN 128: Corruptions (.pdf) AN 8.64: At Gāyā Head (.pdf) AN 8.30: Anuruddha (.pdf) MN 106: Conducive to the Imperturbable (.pdf) SN 47.3: A Bhikkhu (.pdf) AN 8.63: A Teaching in Brief (.pdf) MN 68: At Naḷakapāna (.pdf) MN 49: On the Invitation of Brahmā (.pdf) MN 127: With Anuruddha (.pdf) MN 119: Kāyagatāsati Sutta (Mindfulness of the Body) (.pdf) AN 6.60: Hatthisāriputta (.pdf) AN 7.58: Nothing to Hide (.pdf) AN 10.72: Thorns (.pdf) MN 113: A Good Person (.pdf) As you study these parallel Pāli and Āgama discourses, remember that these two recensions were seperated by thousands of miles and hundreds of years. Note the similarities and differences. How reliable do you feel the Early Buddhist Texts are now, as records of what the Buddha actually taught?",

        "content": "What is the Pāli Language? The Pāli Language is the simplified form of Sanskrit that Theravada Buddhism uses as its liturgical language. It is the only Indic language to preserve a large corpus of Early Buddhist Texts, so studying Pāli (and the Suttas preserved in it) brings us as close as possible to how the historic Buddha taught. Pāli is not a tonal language and (like Sanskrit) is inflected, meaning that the nouns change suffixes depending on their role in the sentence. This course will introduce those various roles (called “cases”) and give a lot of practice deciphering them. Course Outline This course doesn’t assume any prior knowledge of linguistics or classical languages, and so serves as a suitable introduction for anyone. Note that the examples will not be drawn directly from the Pāli Canon. Textbook Pāli Primer – Lily de Silva (.pdf) An excellent primer introducing, step-by-step, the basic grammatical concepts essential to understanding the Pāli language. This Primer makes its concepts approachable and fun, and sets the student up well for studying more advanced textbooks, such as Warder or Duroiselle, later. You can get the book’s answer key here. Lectures Pāli Primer (Course) – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.mp3s) Bhikkhu Bodhi will guide us through DeSilva in 26, 2-hour lectures. In addition to the textbook, there are a number of handouts that Bhikkhu Bodhi provided and will reference in his lectures, so be sure to download those too. Note that significant homework will assigned between each lecture. As these assignments are the bulk of the learning for the course, please be sure to do them.

        "content": "What is the Pāli Language? Pāli is the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism. An ancient, colloquial relative of Sanskrit, Pāli benefits from a number of ambiguities and variations. A testament to Pāli’s long history, such irregularities can make Pāli tricky to decipher, but (thankfully) did little to corrupt the Pali Canon as a record of the Buddha’s teachings. While the Pāli Canon is unlikely to be the verbatim words of the Buddha, studying the Pāli Language is still as close as we can get to hearing his original voice. Course Information This course is an introduction to reading the Pāli Canon in its original language. Prerequisites Though you need not have taken the “Level 1” Primer Course to take this class, some prior knowledge of Pāli or Sanskrit is required. This course also assumes prior comfort with the doctrinal content of the Canon as it focuses more on language acquisition than philosophical engagement. Time Requirement There are approximately 40 hours of lectures (depending on which section you take) and approximately as much homework. Textbook A New Course in Reading Pāli – James W. Gair and W. S. Karunatillake A classic introductory textbook for reading the Pāli Canon in its original language, this reader walks the student through progressively more challenging selections, introducing and explaining the grammatical concepts and vocabulary every step of the way. Lectures This course is taught, once again, by Bhikkhu Bodhi, but this time in two sections. Another Pali Course – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.MP3s) This version of the course was taught in 53 lectures to students who had just completed his “Primer” course. If you are taking this “Level 2” course having just completed the “Level 1” course, this is likely the set of lectures you’ll want to take as it picks up exactly where the previous course left off. A New Pali Course – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.MP3s) This version of the class was taught in 34 lectures to a new group of students. If you’re coming to this course having not taken “Level 1” but with prior knowledge of Pali or Sanskrit from elsewhere, this set of lectures is for you. Homework Note that significant homework will be assigned in this class. As the homework is the bulk of the learning for the course, please be sure to do it.

        "content": "What is Chinese Buddhist Writing? Starting with haphazard translations of Indian Sutras and culminating in majestic works of literature and philosophy, texts written in Chinese characters have long been crucial to the development of Buddhism in China—and by extension all of East Asia. But Sanskrit and Pali are very different languages from Chinese. Chinese is not inflected, largely monosyllabic and has a vastly different phonology and cosmology. This made the job of translating Indian Sutras into Chinese writing very difficult, and thus makes our job decyphering their work just as tricky. But, just as translating the Buddha’s words into Chinese enriched Chinese society, so too do the Chinese Buddhist Texts enrich ours when translated into English. Introduction This course teaches you how to read Buddhist texts in Chinese. Note that this course is still a work in progress by its author, John Kieschnick. The copy presented here is up-to-date as of December 2020, but you should check out Professor Kieschnick’s original webpage to be sure you get the latest materials. Prerequisites While this course is primarily intended for English speakers with prior knowledge of Mandarin, it is designed to be (with the help of supplemental materials listed below) accessible to any student with time and courage. Textbooks The course is, as mentioned above, largely a copy-paste of John Kieschnick’s excellent (currently six volume!) Primer in Chinese Buddhist Writings. It procedes in four parts, corresponding to his three numbered volumes followed by the three supplemental volumes. Volume 1: Foundations Foundations of Chinese Buddhist Writing – John Kieschnick and Simon Wiles (.pdf) (.pdf) a series of lessons that introduce basic vocabulary and grammar, drawing on one authentic text Note that the website and PDF linked above are not precisely identical versions. The answer key for the web version can be found here and here are the pdf answers Audio recordings of the Chinese can be listened to here. The learning objective for this first section is to read (and understand!) an entire Sūtra in Chinese—ideally without having to look at a glossary or dictionary. General Resources for Learning Chinese This is an extremely challenging but doable goal for someone new to Chinese. If this is you, I recommend the following resources to help learn the basics of the Chinese language: Train Chinese An excellent collection of apps for phones, tablets and desktop computers for learning the fundamentals of Chinese. I especially recommend their mobile app “Pinyin Trainer” for learning the phonetics of the Chinese language throughout your day. ChineseSkill An excellent app for learning modern Mandarin Chinese from the ground up, with lessons covering exactly what you would hope from any introductory language class, presented in a simple and reasuring design. Drops Five minutes a day of fun, free, and effective vocabulary acquisition in a large number of Eastern (and Western) languages—Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Tagalog and many many more. Online Chinese grammar notes An elementary grammar textbook for (modern) Mandarin Chinese. Note that the image files unable to load to the right of the Chinese examples are actually links to audio recordings. And even for the bilingual English-Chinese speakers, I recommend everyone get: Pleco The world’s best Chinese dictionaries. Note that students of this course may wish to purchase the optional “Flashcards” feature which will allow you to install this custom dictionary containing the vocab for the class and review said vocabulary in a flashcard-like interface. Make sure to also download the (free) “Buddhist” Dictionary Add-on after you install the app, as it has many Buddhist terms the standard dictionary does not, based on The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism. This Chinese-Sanskrit Dictionary may also be helpful for translating Chinese Buddhist texts, keeping in mind that native Chinese and Buddhist Chinese aren’t quite the same language: On some Basic Features of Buddhist Chinese – Zhu Qingzhi (.pdf) The differences between Buddhist Chinese and the native Chinese language found in non-Buddhist documents are obvious. Volume 2: The Indian Tradition Once you’ve successfully completed the sutra in Volume 1, Volume 2 will introduce the three main EBT genres. The Indian Tradition through Chinese Buddhist Writings – John Kieschnick (.pdf) (.pdf) This volume assumes knowledge of the first, introducing three types of writings from texts translated in China from Indian originals in medieval times. The answer key for this textbook can be found on Google Drive, here. Like Volume 1, the final goal of this section of the course is also to read some Chinese texts with minimal reference to a dictionary—this time a sūtra, some short abhidharma passages, and a section of the vinaya. As these selections represent the full range of “Hinayana” texts preserved in Chinese translation, a student of early Buddhism has, at this point, finished the course and is ready to be a comparative, textual scholar! Volume 3: Texts Composed in China For those students of Mahayana Buddhism, however, the fun is only just beginning! Buddhist Texts Composed in China – John Kieschnick (.pdf) (.pdf) This textbook, following up on the previous two in the series, takes us past the Chinese translations of Indian texts in order to introduce the corpus of premodern texts of Chinese origin. Note that the answer key for the book can be found on Google Drive, here and that there are a few supplemental volumes to this one, covering special topics of interest to those studying the Mahayana and Esoteric Texts or Chinese Epigraphy which can be found on the author’s website. Volume 3 (whose structure should, by now, be very familiar!) should be completed first, followed by the Mahāyāna “supplemental” volume and then the Esoteric and Epigraphic volumes if interest and time remain. Continuing Study As we wrap up, I’d like to give a brief shoutout here to SuttaCentral and the Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō Text Database (SAT 2015) which host a very large number of canonical Buddhist texts in Chinese—most of which have yet to be translated into English. 祝你一路順利!",

        "content": "Who was the Buddha? “Buddha” (properly speaking) refers, not to a single individual, but rather to a category of beings: those who have, through their own effort, attained complete enlightenment. But, more typically, “the Buddha” refers to the Sakyan prince who, in the 5th century BCE Gangetic Plain, first rediscovered nibbāna and taught the way for attaining it. Over 500 million people now worship the Buddha as their teacher, but the Buddha was no God. Indeed, it’s even said that a Buddha can only arise as a human—never as a deity (deva)— because only the human realm balances the misfortunes and mistakes of life which are necessary to motivate the practice, with the ease and discernment which allow it to ripen. But while the Buddha was born a man, a man he did not remain. Through his superior striving and wisdom (over countless eons) he was able to transcend gender, caste, creed, identities, views, suffering and even death itself and to teach others how to transcend themselves too. We call such a teacher, “Buddha.” Prerequisites If you’re looking for a quick and inspiring biography of the Buddha, I recommend The Biography of Shakyamuni Buddha by Master Hsing Yun. This course goes beyond the basics to reading the primary sources themselves, and therefore requires some comfort reading the Early Buddhist Texts. Course Materials This syllabus has no associated lectures. It weaves together several, free books, mostly on the Pāli texts. Textbooks Main Anthology The Life of the Buddha – Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli Thera (.pdf) This classic, quirky anthology gives a good presentation of the Canonical account of the Buddha’s life. It will be the primary biography used in this course, and we will follow the book’s ordering of events. Other Anthologies To supplement Ñanamoli’s judicious selections from the Pāli Canon, we will use these anthologies to underline a couple themes I think worth dwelling on: Teacher of the Devas – Susan E. Jootla (.pdf) (.epub) To understand the Buddhist cosmology requires seeing the way the Gods and the Buddha related with one another. Buddha, My Refuge – Laurence Khantipalo Mills (.pdf) While it is important to mine the Pāli literature for historical and mythological details, it is also important to not lose sight of the Buddha’s extraordinary personal qualities, explained in this anthology through the nine characteristics of the Buddha. Primary Texts There’s one significant primary text in this course, but it isn’t an early text. The Nidānakathā: Introduction to the Jātaka Stories (.pdf) (.epub) This traditional Pāli commentary contains one of the first systematic biographies of the Buddha and formed the basis for many of the later hagiographies. While not necessarily a reliable source of information about the historical Buddha himself, it is of critical importance for understanding the myths and stories about the Buddha which persist today. Academic Works A number of articles and essays will be weaved in throughout the course. We’ll also be reading these two, free books: Original Versions of Some Entries for the Encyclopedia of Buddhism – Peter Harvey (.pdf) A collection of Encyclopedia articles introducing the Buddha from one of the English language’s best authors of rigorous introductions. The Genesis of the Bodhisattva Ideal – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.pdf) In this monograph, the renowned scholar of early Buddhism explores what the early literature can tell us about how the Buddha became the Buddha: a topic of extraordinary importance in later centuries. Course Outline I’ve sequenced the above books into an inter-woven, narrative arc which I (at least!) find compelling. If I were to actually teach this course, I’d perhaps meet twice per week for 13 weeks. The readings below have been bunched together according to this hypothetical schedule, but for individual study you’re of course welcome to work through the readings as you like.

        "content": "What is the Stilling of the Mind? The core of dependant origination is the reciprocal relationship between consciousness and name-and-form. We think that we exist because we feel like we exist and we feel like we exist because we think we do. Unraveling this self-perpetuating feedback loop requires significant effort to cut through our conceptual layers to see the reality of our experience unfiltered by ignorance. When ignorance is broken through, the activity of name-and-form completely stops and consciousness is unconditioned. This, just this, is the cessation of suffering. Prerequisites This is an advanced course which assumes considerable prior engagement with the Pali Suttas and Buddhist Philosophy (in particular Dependant Origination and Buddhist Psychology ). Textbook This course is based on Bhikkhu Ñāṇananda’s sermons: Nibbāna: The Mind Stilled – Bhikkhu Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda (.pdf) all pathways for verbal expression, terminology and designation converge on this whirlpool between name-and-form and consciousness The Nivane Niveema are a series of thirty-three sermons on Nibbāna, originally delivered in Sinhala during the period 1988–1991 and given to the assembly of monks in Nissaraṇa Vanaya, Meethirigala, one of Sri Lanka’s most respected meditation monasteries in the strict forest tradition. The English translations were released in 7 vols. between 2003 and 2012 and continue to brilliantly challenge the traditional Theravada exegesis. Lectures The Nibbāna Lectures – Bhikkhu Anālayo (.MP3s) Bhikkhu Anālayo reads the above lectures, adding his own insightful reflections as well as giving us alternative translations for some of the suttas quoted. If you prefer to watch the lectures on YouTube, they can be found in this playlist Course Outline The course procedes linearly through the lectures (no surprise). You can read along with Bhante’s lectures either in the original book, or in his lecture notes which contain the alternative translations mentioned. Of course, meditation and reflection “outside of class” is encouraged. As ever, if you have any questions, feel free to post on DhammaWheel or SuttaCentral. This course is a real treat. I hope you enjoy it!",

        "content": "What are the Numerical Discourses? The Aṅguttara Nikaya (AN) is the last of the four main books (nikāya) of the Buddha’s discourses (also known as the Sutta Piṭaka) in the Pāḷi Canon. The Buddha often taught according to numbered lists throughout his career as a teacher, as anyone familiar with Buddhist doctrine will know. In fact, this memorable quality of a list is one of its great advantages as a format and the AN takes full advantage of this technique and hence its name. From DN 33, we know that the Saṅgha would often recite the Buddha’s teachings in numerical order even during the Buddha’s own lifetime, so it isn’t hard to imagine how the tradition came to form the Aṅguttara Nikaya as we have it today. The first book (AN 1) contains a multitude of teachings on “one thing”, the second book (AN 2) contains teachings on “two things”, etc. The Aṅguttara Nikaya contains some of the most practical suttas in the entire canon: for monastics and the laity. Being organized around a theme as abstract as numbers (starting with the number one!), the AN contains a rich variety of subjects sure to appeal to readers of any level or interest. Prerequisites This course is technically a continuation of Bhikkhu Bodhi’s epic, multi-year course on the Majjhimā Nikaya, but don’t let that scare you off! This course is designed to be approachable by anyone with a basic understanding of Buddhism and of the Early Buddhist Texts. Time Requirement As of 2021, the course is still ongoing, with new lectures appearing every couple of weeks. I recommend watching one or two videos per week to slowly catch up, but you’re welcome to watch at whatever pace works for you. Course Outline This course goes sequentially through the Aṅguttara Nikaya, explaining each sutta or sutta cluster one at a time. Textbook A copy of the Aṅguttara Nikaya is required for this class. Bhikkhu Bodhi’s own translation is, of course, preferred: The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Aṅguttara Nikāya – Bhikkhu Bodhi The lecturer’s own translation of the text. A free preview can be found on ReadingFaithfully, here. You can also find Bhikkhu Sujato’s translation free online: The Numbered Discourses – Bhante Sujato (.pdf) (.epub) In addition to being freely available, it’s also helpful to see alternative translations to get a sense of the breadth of meaning in the original. Ajahn Geoff has also translated a few suttas from the AN over at DhammaTalks.org Lectures Anguttara Nikaya Course – Bhikkhu Bodhi (.MP4s) All the lectures for the class can be found on YouTube and on Google Drive at the links above. Note that the videos on YouTube are slightly out of order and that the Drive video files can be downloaded for offline viewing, but may not include the latest videos.",

        "content": "With Khemarato Bhikkhu Alas! Asaṅga spent twelve years in the wilderness, practising meditation. Without achieving any success in meditation, He has instead compiled these treatises As a burden for an elephant’s back. ~ Vasubandhu Background Most schools of Buddhism in Asia have a standardized curriculum for monastics and those of faith. The Gelukpa has the “Geshe” degree, Thailand has the “Nak Tham” exams, but the “Modern” Buddhism focused on the earliest Buddhist texts which is emerging in the English-speaking world today still has no such academic standard. Perhaps that makes sense as we’re still figuring it out! But while our field is new, it is also large enough now that students of Buddhist Studies need guidance through the vast corpus. When I ordained as a monk, I personally felt that need and looked around for a curriculum to help me. Rejecting both sectarian and secular structures, however, I found myself assembling my own study-plan from what I could find online. Fortunately, there is quite a lot! Having organized that in Google Drive for my own studies, I started to share what I had compiled with my friends, who later encouraged me to turn it into this website. This Website There are two primary ways to use the site: taking the self-paced courses or hanging out at the library. The library contains all the best content I’ve found organized by topic (as well as a few other ways). These topical bibliographies are then organized into course syllabi which can be studied online or used in your study group or class. There are already students and teachers around the world using the material here in a variety of ways and I couldn’t be prouder! Methodology After reading/listening to something good online (or elsewhere), I consider what I learned from the piece and who I’d recommend it to. After answering those questions affirmatively, I squirrel away the e.g. PDF into an appropriate subfolder on Google Drive corresponding to the topic at hand. When a given subfolder has accumulated a fairly broad range of material, I then add its contents to this website, and add the folder as a new “tag” on the topics page. As a map of my mind, that ontology (editorially and structurally) contains all my personal biases. This is a feature not a bug. I named my elephants with thought, care, and delight and I hope that, as you explore my library, you will find some of that delight too. 😊 🐘 About the Code This is a static HTML website built with Jekyll and served by GitHub Pages. (Feel free to skip this section if you’re not interested in the technical details.) Running the site locally To run the site locally, clone the repo, then run “bundle install” and “bundle exec jekyll serve” keeping in mind that the build may take up to 30 mins. To speed that up, you have two options: You can add the --config _config.yml,_quick_build.yml build flag for a faster, but partial build. You can serve the production build locally like so: rm -rf _site git branch -D prod git pull git checkout prod cp -r . _site git checkout master JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --skip-initial-build For more information on the build process, see the Jekyll docs. The Source Code You can think of each of the _folders in the source code as representing individual object types. Each folder is a different “table” in the hardcoded “database.” _authors - Each author with their own page. _content - All of the individual works in the library, divided by category based on the type. Each content item has a number of metadata fields listing its bibliographic information (e.g. pages) in Bibtex format, or linking the entry out to its file (e.g. external_url) or linking it to its internal groups (e.g. authors). Conventionally, I put raw strings in \"Quotes\" and I represent links to other objects as unquoted-slugs. The templates then use these slugs to fetch the related objects at page render time. _categories - This folder houses the index.html pages for the /content/* folders and contains a little metadata about the categories, such as their plain English titles. _courses - The University’s courses. _data - Site configuration variables. _drafts - Unpublished courses or blog posts. _includes - A Jekyll folder which houses the site’s reusable UI components. _journals - Periodicals which get their own page. _layouts houses the html page templates. _plugins is not a collection but rather contains native Ruby extensions for quickly running complex algorithms or for dynamically generating content. Currently my only custom plugin is the similar content engine which you can read about here _posts are the blog posts which make up the newsletter. _publishers are the publishers which I have granted their own hub. _sass contains the site’s css. _series - Are collections of _content items that were published as part of a numbered series (specified by fields on the content item) _tags - The bibliographic topics, arranged in a directed, ontological graph via the parents field. _tests - A couple of pages with Integration Tests I have used during development in the past, and decided to keep around in case the code is useful in the future. Lastly, .github/workflows contains my GitHub Actions Workflow files which build the site and check for certain errors. For questions about the source code, feel free to email me or post an issue or comment on GitHub. Reuse The beauty of Jekyll is that it outputs plain HTML, which you can find in the repo’s “prod” branch. This raw html can be reworked in a variety of ways or you can fork the repo to use the source code. The entire database can also be found in Bibtex format here, in case that’s helpful, for example for importing into an academic reference manager. Feel free to reuse this website in any (ethical) way you like consistent with the attached MIT License. Future Directions Over the next few years, I’d like to expand the University’s offerings further: into various regional forms of Buddhism, subtler points of Buddhist philosophy, the grand arcs of history, and much, much more. I’d also like to continue to improve the site’s design and marketing, so it can be as accessible as possible. If you’d like to contribute, comment on an open issue on GitHub or email me with your own idea for a project and we’ll take it from there! It is my hope that this curriculum will provide a basis for Buddhist Studies for decades to come. Disclaimers This repository, like all things, is imperfect and subject to change. While I have taken some pains to ensure that everything here is accurate and legal, please know that you use the University at your own risk. The various views expressed in each work are the opinions of the respective author(s) and may or may not reflect my own. Acknowledgements A big thank you to the content sources, to Google (for hosting the Drive library), to GitHub for hosting the site, and to all the various content creators and publishers who generously put their work out there for free. It’s a testament to Buddhist generosity that such an expansive and outstanding collection can be compiled (almost entirely) from free material.
