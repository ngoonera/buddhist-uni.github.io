  &lt;p&gt;Menocchio was certain that at death man reverted to the elements of which he was composed. But an irresistible yearning drove him to picture some sort of survival after death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A riveting reconstruction of the thought-world of a particular, early modern, Italian peasant whom had fashioned for himself an unpopular popular cosmology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The victory of written over oral culture has been, principally, the victory of the abstract over the empirical.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;a book about people trying to solve problems created by people trying to solve problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few case studies of man setting out to fix his environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By zooming in on tiny fish and out to the entire stratosphere, it beautifully captures the staggering scope of climate change and its challenges.
In highlighting the scientists and engineers working on it, the book offers a somewhat more hopeful picture of our possible future: less apocalyptic but still incredibly strange.
See &lt;a href=&quot;/content/av/model-organism_99pi&quot;&gt;99pi’s “Model Organism”&lt;/a&gt; for a taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also makes a strong case for being sceptical that we even can engineer our way out of climate change.
While it nods to the “but what other choice do we have” counterargument, I hope that readers come away from this tension in the book more confident than ever in our need for decarbonization and I hope that readers won’t leap to even worse ideas than those highlighted in the book, such as fatalism or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/9/26/16356524/the-population-question&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;population control&lt;/a&gt;.

  &lt;p&gt;I invite the reader to join me in a search for what could be found in the textual corpus of early Buddhist discourses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the first chapter I investigate the bodhisattva conception as such, surveying relevant passages from the early discourses. With the second chapter I turn to the meeting between the previous Buddha Kāśyapa and the bodhisattva Gautama, examining the relation of this meeting to the notion of a vow the bodhisattva took to pursue the path to Buddhahood. The future Buddha Maitreya is the theme of the third chapter, in which I take up the notion of a prediction a bodhisattva receives in assurance of his future success.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Holocaust survivor describes the mental hoops he (and many) prisoners jumped through during their trying time so close to death. He concludes that people needed a reason to live, a “will to meaning,” as a necessary core of their psychological health, without which survival was impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In America, the book became wildly popular for its descriptions of life in the German concentration camps and for its feel-good defense of positive thinking and a generic, rationalized, Judeo-Christian spirituality. Personally, I read Frankl’s anecdotes more as a defense of &lt;em&gt;ethical behavior&lt;/em&gt;  in the face of death less than as a defense of the imagination and its attachments as he imaged. As he himself points out: those survivors most strongly attached to hope where those most strongly disillusioned by their return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankl’s Judeo-Christian lens also prohibited him from engaging in more sober self-analysis in ways that are worth unpacking for what they say about Western culture more broadly. For example, it’s more than a little problematic that Frankl approvingly (!) quotes Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the final analysis, &lt;em&gt;Man’s Search for Meaning&lt;/em&gt; remains a complex classic, as much in need of psychoanalysis as it purports to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Viktor Frankl</name></author><category term="monographs" /><category term="inner" /><category term="ideology" /><summary type="html">We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Living Buddhist Masters</title><link href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/modern-buddhist-masters_kornfield" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Living Buddhist Masters" /><published>2020-10-29T10:26:52+07:00</published><updated>2021-03-12T21:59:13+07:00</updated><id>https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/modern-buddhist-masters_kornfield</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/modern-buddhist-masters_kornfield">&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The beautiful, almost without any effort of our own, acquaints us with the mental event of conviction, and so pleasurable a mental state is this that ever afterwards one is willing to labor, struggle, wrestle with the world to locate enduring sources of conviction–to locate what is true. …beauty is a starting place for education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A thorough defense of beauty and of its power to push the boundaries of our concern outward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not written from the Buddhist perspective, these essays dismiss (too?) casually the ugly failure modes of beauty: the acquisitiveness, possessiveness, and jealousy which consume many the beholder. However, I find it a useful corollary or even corrective to the standard Buddhist “rejection” of aesthetics, explaining how beauty can condition becoming’s wholesome forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, we start to view the &lt;em&gt;spiritual&lt;/em&gt; education as a kind of &lt;em&gt;aesthetic&lt;/em&gt; education: acquainting the student with “truer” sources of beauty and affording them the more sublime responses outlined in these notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Elaine Scarry</name></author><category term="monographs" /><category term="pedagogy" /><category term="activism" /><category term="beauty" /><category term="aesthetics" /><category term="art" /><category term="inner" /><summary type="html">The beautiful, almost without any effort of our own, acquaints us with the mental event of conviction, and so pleasurable a mental state is this that ever afterwards one is willing to labor, struggle, wrestle with the world to locate enduring sources of conviction–to locate what is true. …beauty is a starting place for education.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Ekottarika-āgama Studies</title><link href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/ea-studies_analayo" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ekottarika-āgama Studies" /><published>2020-09-16T17:38:39+07:00</published><updated>2020-09-16T17:38:39+07:00</updated><id>https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/ea-studies_analayo</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/monographs/ea-studies_analayo">&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the discovery and ongoing publication of the incomplete Sanskrit Dīrgha-āgama manuscript from Gilgit, three different versions of the Collection of Long Discourses are now available for comparative study: the Pali Dīgha-nikāya transmitted within the Theravāda tradition, the just-mentioned Dīrgha-āgama in Sanskrit, identified as Sarvāstivāda or Mūlasarvāstivāda, and the Chinese translation of an Indic Dīrgha-āgama (長阿含經), generally considered to be affiliated with the Dharmaguptakas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The seminar, “The Chinese Translation of the Dīrgha-āgama (長 阿含經, Taishō 1)”, took place on 18 and 19 October, 2013. It was organised in collaboration with the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies at Dharma Drum Mountain and the Numata Center for Bud- dhist Studies at Hamburg University. The event was generously funded by the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.
In this volume, we publish most of the papers that were presented and discussed at the seminar, with the chapters – six in total – arranged according to the authors’ names in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this thousand-page tome, Bhikkhu Analayo goes systematically through the MN, one sutta at a time, and explains how the Pāli text differs (or not) from its  parallels preserved in Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan. Perhaps surprisingly, they don’t differ all that much, though in some places the differences do shed light on the original teaching and shows what kinds of changes occurred to the texts during the process of transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book begins and ends with Bhikkhu Analayo’s reflections on the EBTs and the process of oral transmission, and while the book could certainly be read cover-to-cover, the primary way to use this book is as a reference work alongside the Majjhima Nikaya.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Psychopaths are more likely to be attracted to singing, dancing, love, light, miracles, and channeling. Usually psychopaths have a great deal of trouble sitting quiet and still. I appreciate the boring facade of Buddhism, as it is a great protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new age mystic gives his advice on how to identify psychopaths on the spiritual journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Bill’s many painful experiences, he never lost his faith in the transformative, human potential to awaken. His lifetime of spiritual stumbling is a rich source of warnings and advice, especially for Westerners still struggling to get a foothold in a tradition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, however, the book’s interpretation of “enlightenment” should be taken cautiously, as his understanding seems to come from ecumenical assumptions that the various “contemplative traditions” (never defined) all describe the same goal. A bit of a black sheep even within the heterodox, secular “Insight”  community, Bill Hamilton is best read with his own warning in mind, that “monks and nuns make safer teachers than laypeople, especially if they are actively associated with their tradition.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>William Hamilton</name></author><category term="monographs" /><category term="form" /><category term="pedagogy" /><category term="selling" /><category term="vinaya-studies" /><category term="ethics" /><category term="power" /><category term="charisma" /><category term="new-age" /><summary type="html">Psychopaths are more likely to be attracted to singing, dancing, love, light, miracles, and channeling.

  &lt;p&gt;Just as the sun is valued not only for its own intrinsic radiance but also for its ability to illuminate the world, so the brilliance of the Buddha is determined not only by the clarity of his Teaching but by his ability to illuminate those who came to him for refuge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha’s first generation of followers established the traditions and values of the early Sangha.  Indeed, it is nearly impossible to understand Buddhism without understanding the lives of the early Buddhist saints.

  &lt;p&gt;Growing tolerance toward Asian peoples and cultures was fostered in a mass-mediated environment in which the role of the visual image took on increasing importance. While this environment allowed a popular engagement with Asian religious traditions, it also relied on and reinforced certain racialized notions of Asianness and Asian religiosity. These notions form patterns of representation that, because they are linked to such positive images, go unchallenged and unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
