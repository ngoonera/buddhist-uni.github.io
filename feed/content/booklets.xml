  &lt;p&gt;When Westerners come to Buddhism, they usually approach it through the doors of psychology, history of religions, or perennial philosophy, all of which are dominated by Romantic ways of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu takes us on a long tour of Romantic philosophy before eventually showing how Romantic sensibilities affected the reception of Buddhism in the West. Most helpful is his list in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhammatalks.org/books/BuddhistRomanticism/Section0012.html#sigil_toc_id_43&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chapter 7&lt;/a&gt; where he outlines specifically the differences he sees between Buddhism and Western Romanticism. Even if you ultimately disagree with Ajahn Geoff’s analysis, this is still an important work to engage with seriously, as it forces a direct confrontation with our religious assumptions and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ajahn Geoff Ṭhānissaro</name><uri>https://buddhistuniversity.net/authors/geoff</uri></author><category term="booklets" /><category term="dialogue" /><category term="romanticism" /><category term="secular" /><category term="perennial" /><category term="function" /><category term="philosophy" /><category term="religion" /><category term="west" /><summary type="html">When Westerners come to Buddhism, they usually approach it through the doors of psychology, history of religions, or perennial philosophy, all of which are dominated by Romantic ways of thinking.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nibbāna and the Fire Simile</title><link href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/nibbana-and-the-fire-simile_nyanananda" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nibbāna and the Fire Simile" /><published>2020-07-31T10:07:25+07:00</published><updated>2021-12-23T14:27:41+07:00</updated><id>https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/nibbana-and-the-fire-simile_nyanananda</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/nibbana-and-the-fire-simile_nyanananda">&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The mind of equanimity, poised beyond the play of worldly opposites, is the highest safety and security, but to gain this equanimity we stand in need of guidance. The guidance available cannot protect us from objective adversity. It can only safeguard us from the dangers of a negative response—from anxiety, sorrow, frustration, and despair. This is the only protection possible, and because it grants us this essential protection such guidance can be considered a genuine refuge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the thousands of years separating us from the Buddha, Bhikkhu Cintita asks the excellent question of how it is that Buddhism has survived so well across time and cultures, and then uses this theory to ponder how modern, Western practitioners should approach this question of “Sasana.” An excellent and rare introduction to the sociology of Buddhism “from the inside,” this book is a must-read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bhikkhu Cintita</name><uri>https://buddhistuniversity.net/authors/cintita</uri></author><category term="booklets" /><category term="monastic" /><category term="west" /><category term="buddhism" /><category term="form" /><summary type="html">The Monastic Sangha is both training ground and dwelling place for the Noble Sangha, much like a university is both a training ground and a dwelling place for scholars.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path</title><link href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Buddhist Life, Buddhist Path" /><published>2020-03-08T16:58:36+07:00</published><updated>2021-03-15T11:42:05+07:00</updated><id>https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/booklets/buddhist-life-buddhist-path_cintita">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You will experience many sensual pleasures in your life: food, music, sex and zombie movies. You should become aware as well of the great joy, a pleasure beyond the sensual, that comes with generosity. Become aware that this joy is greatest when your intentions are purest, when the recipients of your generosity are worthy and when the manner of giving is proper. This joy is the direct experience of the merit you have earned.&lt;/p&gt;
