  &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the discovery and ongoing publication of the incomplete Sanskrit Dīrgha-āgama manuscript from Gilgit, three different versions of the Collection of Long Discourses are now available for comparative study: the Pali Dīgha-nikāya transmitted within the Theravāda tradition, the just-mentioned Dīrgha-āgama in Sanskrit, identified as Sarvāstivāda or Mūlasarvāstivāda, and the Chinese translation of an Indic Dīrgha-āgama (長阿含經), generally considered to be affiliated with the Dharmaguptakas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The seminar, “The Chinese Translation of the Dīrgha-āgama (長 阿含經, Taishō 1)”, took place on 18 and 19 October, 2013. It was organised in collaboration with the Chung-Hwa Institute of Buddhist Studies at Dharma Drum Mountain and the Numata Center for Bud- dhist Studies at Hamburg University. The event was generously funded by the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for International Scholarly Exchange.
In this volume, we publish most of the papers that were presented and discussed at the seminar, with the chapters – six in total – arranged according to the authors’ names in alphabetical order.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;in what follows I briefly survey the four main Chinese Āgamas. In the first of the chapters that follow this introduction, I try to place the early discourses in historical perspective. An assessment of their value as testimonies for early Buddhist thought serves as a foundation for the comparative studies found in this and the other three volumes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Although some parts of the manuscript are still unavailable, and others are most probably lost forever, it is now possible to reconstruct the original structure of the collection with such a high degree of probability as to come close to certainty. In the following pages first a survey of all the sūtras contained in the Dirghāgama will be given, and then, second, a specimen edition of a section of one of those sūtras.&lt;/p&gt;
