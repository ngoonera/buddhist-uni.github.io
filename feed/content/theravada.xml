&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly a commentary on a single verse from the Dhammapada, this classic work synthesized the Buddhist Path into a single, comprehensive progression of purification from approaching the path, to purifying ethics, to purifying the mind with meditation and eventually insight. It is from the Visuddhimagga that we get the threefold division of the path into Sīla, Samādhi and Paññā. The ideas of “neighborhood” concentration, the confusion over samatha and vipassana, and much else in the contemporary Theravada world can all be traced back to this enormously influential tome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its day, a landmark of commentarial scholarship and synthesis, today it contains some of the clearest and most detailed descriptions of the advanced stages of meditation that we have from ancient times. Despite, or perhaps even because of, the text’s limitations and subsequent disagreements over their correct interpretation, the Visuddhimagga is certain to remain a vital part of the Buddhist Tradition for centuries to come.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Bhadantācariya Buddhaghosa</name></author><category term="canon" /><category term="iddhi" /><category term="samadhi" /><category term="meditation" /><category term="path" /><category term="theravada" /><summary type="html">The essential meditation manual of the Theravada Tradition and the book that, legend has it, convinced the Sri Lankan elders to allow Acariya Buddhaghosa to write the (now quasi-canonical) Pāli Commentaries.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Lao Buddhist Women: Quietly Negotiating Religious Authority</title><link href="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/lao-buddhist-women_tsomo-karma-lekshe" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lao Buddhist Women: Quietly Negotiating Religious Authority" /><published>2020-10-29T10:26:52+07:00</published><updated>2021-01-10T15:17:15+07:00</updated><id>https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/lao-buddhist-women_tsomo-karma-lekshe</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://buddhistuniversity.net/content/articles/lao-buddhist-women_tsomo-karma-lekshe">&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Just as the sun is valued not only for its own intrinsic radiance but also for its ability to illuminate the world, so the brilliance of the Buddha is determined not only by the clarity of his Teaching but by his ability to illuminate those who came to him for refuge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha’s first generation of followers established the traditions and values of the early Sangha.  Indeed, it is nearly impossible to understand Buddhism without understanding the lives of the early Buddhist saints. This rich and inspiring series of biographies editted by Bhikkhu Bodhi mainly draws from the traditional commentaries of the Theravada tradition and so provides an excellent balance between readability and faithfulness to the source material. A must read for all students of Buddhism.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ven.
